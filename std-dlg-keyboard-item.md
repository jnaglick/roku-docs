StdDlgKeyboardItem
==================

Extends [StdDlgItemBase](/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/std-dlg-item-base.md "**StdDlgItemBase**")

The **StdDlgKeyboardItem** node is used to display a keyboard or PINpad in the dialog's content area. It provides text and voice entry of strings containing alphanumeric characters and symbols or numeric digits. It should only be used as a child of a [**StdDlgContentArea**](/docs/references/scenegraph/standard-dialog-framework-nodes/std-dlg-content-area.md) node.
