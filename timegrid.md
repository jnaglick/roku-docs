TimeGrid
========

OTT providers can use the TimeGrid node to implement an Electronic Program Guide (EPG) in their apps. In an EPG, channels are represented as horizontal rows, one for each channel. Each row has an channel name on the left, and a set of programs airing on that app to the right. The size of each program depends on its duration. One of these programs has a remote control focus highlight indicator on it, and this highlight can be moved around using the remote control (as long as the TimeGrid node has remote control focus).

The TimeGrid node also features an alternative Now/Next view that lists only the programs currently airing and airing next, with their respective start times. See [Now/Next mode](/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/timegrid.md#nownext-mode) for more information.

Fields
------

### Content

The TimeGrid node has a **content** field that can be used to store the information for and programs displayed in the grid. This **content** field should have a single ContentNode that has one child ContentNode per app, and each app ContentNode should have one child ContentNode for each program, sorted by start time in ascending order (earliest programs first).

> For any program in any channel, the start time plus the duration of any program must be less than or equal to the start time of the next program.

#### App attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TITLE | string | The name of this channel, to be visible only if HDSMALLICONURL is not set or if the icon failed to load. |
| HDSMALLICONURL | uri | The image file for the channel logo. |

#### Program attributes

| Attribute | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| TITLE | string | Program title. |
| PLAYSTART | roDateTime | Start time for this program. |
| PLAYDURATION | roDateTime | Duration of this program. |
| HDSMALLICONURL | uri | The image file for an icon that appears beside the program title (optional). |

### General TimeGrid settings

The following fields are used to configure general time grid settings.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| maxDays | int | 7   | Specifies the total width of the time grid in days. |
| contentStartTime | roDateTime | 0   | The earliest time to which the time grid can be scrolled. The scrollable range of times is defined by the sum of the **contentStartTime** and **maxDays** fields. |
| duration | double | 9000 | Width (in seconds) of the visible section of the time grid.  <br>  <br>For example, setting this to 10800 will cause the time grid to display 3 hours of programs horizontally (10,800 = 3 hours \* 3,600 seconds per hour). |
| autoDismissTime | roDateTime | 0   | Specifies the time (in seconds) that the time grid will be displayed before automatically being hidden.  <br>  <br>Setting this field to 0 will cause the time grid to never be hidden. |
| ignoreTrickPlayKeys | boolean | FALSE | If set to true, ignores fast forward, rewind, and instant replay key events.  <br>  <br>Fast forward and rewind key presses normally page the time grid up and down. Instant replay key presses jump the grid to the current time. |
| overlayBitmapUri | uri | ""  | Specifies an overlay that is drawn on top of the entire time grid. This is used by default to make the bottom visible rows of the time grid appear to fade out, but could be used to add any overlay be drawn on top of the time grid. In most cases, this should be a 9-patch image that specifies expandable regions.  <br>  <br>Only set this field to specify a custom bitmap that differs in appearance from the default bitmap. The overlay bitmap is drawn over the full width of the time grid with its bottom aligned to the bottom of the time grid.  <br>  <br>If the **overlayHeight** field value is greater than 0 the image will be stretched to the specified height (that is from the bottom of the time grid to the specified height).  <br>  <br>If **overlayHeight** field value is set to 0 the bitmap will be drawn at its default height. |
| overlayHeight | float | 0   | Specifies the height of the overlay image (see the **overlayBitmapUri** field). If set to 0 the overlay image is drawn at its default height. |

### App settings

The following fields are used to configure and control app selection and focus.

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| focusBitmapUri | uri | ""  | Specifies the bitmap file used for the focus indicator when the list has focus.  <br>  <br>In most cases, this should be a 9-patch image that specifies expandable regions. Only set this field to specify a custom bitmap that differs in appearance from the default bitmap. |
| animateToChannel | int | 0   | Write-only. Scrolls the grid so the row corresponding to the specified app index is on screen. When the scrolling ends, the program in that row at the current focus time will have focus. |
| jumpToChannel | int | 0   | Write-only. Jumps the grid so the row corresponding to the specified app index is on screen. After the jump, the program in that row at the current focus time will have focus. |
| jumpToTime | string | ""  | Write-only. Jumps the grid to the program at the specified time (in UTC format). After the jump, the time will be visible, and the program on the currently focused app will have focus. |
| leftEdgeTargetTime | roDateTime | none | When explicitly set, this triggers a horizontally scrolling animation so that the specified time is displayed at the left edge of the program grid.  <br>  <br>This field is also set by the firmware in response to remote control key presses that cause horizontal scrolling to provide feedback on the currently visible time range. |
| channelSelected | int | 0   | Read-only. Indicates the index of the selected app when the user makes a selection. |
| channelFocused | int | 0   | Read-only. Indicates the index of the focused app when a program in the app's row gains focus. |

| infoGridGap | float | 0   | Spacing between the Channel Information column and the main grid. |
| channelInfoColumnLabel | string | ""  | Specifies text used as a label for the header of the Channel Information column (the text displayed above the Channel Information column).  <br>  <br>If this is not specified, the label will show the day of the week that the left-hand edge of the time grid represents. |
| channelInfoTextColor | color | system default | Specifies the text color for the app names in the Channel Information column if the **channelInfoComponentName** field is not specified. |

Measuring EPG launch times
--------------------------

Apps with an EPG must fire signal beacons to measure the EPG launch time. Beacons must be fired when the user initiates a keypress to display the EPG (**EPGLaunchInitiate**) and when the EPG is fully rendered and navigable (**EPGLaunchComplete**). See [Measuring Channel Performance](/docs/developer-program/performance-guide/measuring-channel-performance.md) for more information.

Sample app
----------

You can download and install a [sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/SceneGraphDeveloperExtensions/tree/master/samples/TimeGridView) that demonstrates how to use the TimeGridView in the SceneGraph Developer Extensions (SGDEX) to create an EPG. This sample app uses a row-by-row loading model. In this model, a handler config running on the root node of a content tree creates a child node for each row in the EPG. Each of the row child nodes has a handler that creates a child node for each program that should be displayed on that row.
