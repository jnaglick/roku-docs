### GetPluralString(count as Integer, zeroString as String, oneString as String, pluralString as String) as String

#### Description

Replaces "^n" in pluralString with count and returns the result.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type |
| --- | --- |
| count | Integer |
| zeroString | String |
| oneString | String |
| pluralString | String |

#### Return Value

The result of the operation. If count is 0, this returns zeroString. If count is 1, it returns oneString.

### GetLocalizedAsset(dirName as String, fileName as String) as String

Returns an appropriate asset path based on the user's currently selected language.

If the user's current language setting is French (fr\_CA), and the file exists, then this would return "pkg:/locale/fr\_CA/images/MyImage.png".

If the file does not exist in the current locale directory, then this will search the directory locale/default/. If it exists there, it will return it; otherwise, it will check the directory locale/en\_US/. If it still can't find the file, then it will return an empty string.

A list of currently supported locales can be found at [ifDeviceInfo.GetCurrentLocale](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdeviceinfo.md#getcurrentlocale-as-string "ifDeviceInfo.GetCurrentLocale").

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| dirName | String | The name of a subdirectory in the directory pkg:/locale/XX\_YY/ where XX\_YY is the current language setting. |
| fileName | String | The name of the file. |

#### Return Value

An asset path.
