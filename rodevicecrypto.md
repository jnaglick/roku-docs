roDeviceCrypto
==============

The roDeviceCrypto component enables you to encrypt and decrypt data on a device using a key that is unique per app, device, or model. Using an app key for example, you can encrypt data for an app so that it may only be decrypted by that same app. In this case, you could provision credentials or an API key from the cloud to devices securely. With a device key for example, you could implement a secure-storage like algorithm.

Description
-----------

roDeviceCrypto has two methods: `Encrypt()` and `Decrypt()`. Both methods take a `roByteArray` and the encryption key type (`encType`), which is a string that may be set to "channel", "device", or "model".

Both methods return a `roByteArray` so that you can encrypt plaintext on a Roku device and then decode it, as demonstrated in the following example:

      ' store plaintext to be encrypted in an roByteArray
      ba = CreateObject("roByteArray")
      ba.FromAsciiString("plain text1")  
    
      ' create roDeviceCrypto object and specify a device key
      dc = CreateObject("roDeviceCrypto")
      encType = "device"
    
      ' encrypt plaintext using the device key and store the encoded data in an roByteArray
      encrypted = dc.Encrypt(ba, encType)
    
      ' decode the encrypted data and store the decrypted data in an roByteArray
      if encrypted <> invalid then
        decrypted = dc.Decrypt(encrypted,encType)
      end if
