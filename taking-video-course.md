Taking the online video course
==============================

Developers can learn how to build a Roku app from the ground up through the [SceneGraph: Build an app online video course](/videos/courses/rsg/overview.md). This course features a set of 13 video lessons and a comprehensive [sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/scenegraph-master-sample) that walks developers through each step in building a basic, high-performance Roku app that passes certification. This course is ideal for developers that are new to the Roku platform and want a simple, streamlined path for quickly understanding Roku development.
