### GetAllPurchases() as Void

#### Description

The **getAllPurchases** function is similar to the [**getPurchases** function](#getpurchases-as-void) except that it requests the historical list of all canceled, expired, and terminated subscriptions over the lifetime of the current user account—in addition to the active subscriptions. You can use this method to leverage purchase history in order to implement subscription renewal flows and more easily determine if subscriptions have expired.

### SetOrder(order as Object, orderInfo as Object) as Void

#### Description

Sets the current Order (shopping cart) to the elements specified in the parameter, which must be an roList of roAssociativeArray items.Passing an empty roList clears the Order, like calling ClearOrder().

#### Parameters

NameTypeDescriptionorderroList of roAssociativeArray itemsEach roAssociativeArray in the roList contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | String | The product identifier |
| qty | Integer | The quantity purchased |

orderInforoAssociativeArrayThis parameter is used for subscription upgrades and downgrades. If it is not specified, the action is a product purchase. It contains the following fields:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| action | String | The action to be performed, which may be one of the following:<br><br>*   "Upgrade": The order is an upgrade from one subscription product to another.<br>*   "Downgrade": The order is a subscription downgrade. |

  
**Example**

    m.store = CreateObject("roChannelStore")​
    ' Populate myOrderItems
    myOrderInfo.action = "Upgrade"
    m.store.setOrder(myOrderItems, myOrderInfo)
    

  
See [On-device upgrade and downgrade](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/on-device-upgrade-downgrade.md#calling-the-roku-web-service-validate-transaction-api) for how to implement Roku Pay web services for upgrades/downgrades.

### ClearOrder() as Void

| Name | Return Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ClearOrder | Void | Clears the current Order (shopping cart). After this call, the Order is empty |

### DeltaOrder(code as Object, qty as Integer) as Integer

#### Description

Applies a change in quantity to one item in the current Order (shopping cart).

*   If the item identified by code is not in the **Order**, it is added with the specified **qty**.
*   If the item already exists in the **Order**, **qty** is added to the quantity of this item in the **Order**.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | String | The product identifier. |
| qty | Integer | The quantity purchased. This may be a negative number. |

#### Return Type

The quantity of the item remaining in the Order after applying the change. If the returned value is zero or negative, the item is deleted from the Order.

### GetOrder() as Object

#### Description

Retrieves the current Order.

#### Return Value

The returned object is an roList of roAssociativeArray items, where each item contains the following parameter names with specified value type:

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | String | The product identifier. |
| qty | Integer | The quantity purchased. |

### DoOrder() as Boolean

#### Description

Displays the Streaming Store Product Purchase Screen populated with information from the current Order.

The user can then either approve and complete the purchase, or cancel the purchase. In the case that the user approves, the app should wait for and respond to the roChannelStoreEvent.isRequestSucceeded event to get the details of the completed transaction.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the user approved the order (true if the order was approved; false otherwise).

### FakeServer(enable as Boolean) as Void

It is recommended that developers use [billing testing](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/testing/billing-testing.md) instead of this method.

#### Description

This test mode short circuits communication to the Streaming Store. It makes other methods get their responses to async queries and operations from configuration files, rather than actual server communication.

> Do not call this method in a production app.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| enable | Boolean | If enable is true, enables a test mode for the roChannelStore component. |

To use this test method, create a **csFake** folder and add the following XML files to it in order to simulate web service request and response data:

*   **csfake/GetCatalog.xml**: Simulates the list of products available for purchase in the app.
*   **csfake/GetPurchases.xml**: Simulates the list of products already purchased by the user.
*   **csfake/PlaceOrder.xml**: Contains information about the product to be ordered.
*   **csfake/CheckOrder.xml**: Verifies the validity of the order placed. For example, if the **order** and **id** values in the PlaceOrder and CheckOrder XML files do not match, the fake server will report an error in the order processing.

See the [SimpleChannelStore sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/roku%20pay/SimpleChannelStore) for how to use this testing method.

### GetUserData() as Object

#### Description

The GetUserData() function provides a way to request user authorization to share the user’s account information with the calling app.

The primary use case of this method is to facilitate partner account creation/updating within apps that have a customer billing relationship with Roku.

For example, a developer may have a Roku app that offers a VOD subscription to users. This subscription may require an account with the content provider. The GetUserData() method could be called to read the user’s account information in order to prepopulate an account registration screen.

#### Return Value

When called, the method presents a dialog screen containing the user’s account information, along with two buttons labeled Share and Don’t Share.

*   If the user presses the **Cancel** button, GetUserData() returns invalid.
*   If the user presses the **Continue** button, GetUserData() returns an roAssociativeArray containing the following Roku account information for the app user (all values are Strings):
    
    *   firstname
    *   lastname
    *   email
    *   street
    *   city
    *   state
    *   zip
    *   country
    *   phone
    *   birth ("YYYY-MM")
    *   gender ("Male", "Female", or unspecified)

> For authenticated free and AVOD apps that are not enrolled in the [Roku Partner Payouts Program](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/partner-payouts.md), a limited set of account information is returned:
> 
> *   **Sign-up RFI screen**: email, phone, and zip.
> *   **Sign-in RFI screen**: email and phone.

### GetPartialUserData(properties as String, requestInfo as Object) as Object

#### Description

This function works like GetUserData(), but allows the caller to specify which user data elements to return. The specified values are also displayed in the user data dialog screen.

#### Parameters

NameTypeDescriptionpropertiesStringA comma-separated list of the attribute names to be returned. For example, to return only the email address and first name of the user's account, you would call GetPartialUserData("email, firstname"). The full set of user account properties that can be queried with the function is:  

*   firstname
*   lastname
*   email
*   street
*   city
*   state
*   zip
*   country
*   phone
*   birth
*   gender

requestInfo  
roAssociativeArraySpecifies whether the RFI screen is used for customer sign-ups or sign-ins. This may be one of the following values:  

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| context | string | "signup" | Specifies the context of the RFI screen, which may be one of the following values:  <br><br>*   "signup": The RFI screen displays a "Let's create your account" title and lists the customer information specified in the [**requestedUserData** field](#requesteduserdata). The RFI screen uses the sign-up context by default.<br>*   "signin: "The RFI screen displays a "Sign in" title and lists only email or phone attributes, if specified in the [**requestedUserData** field](#requesteduserdata). Other attributes are ignored, even if specified.<br><br>  <br>See the [Sign-in example](#sign-in-example) for how to use this field. |

forceShowDataBooleanIf true, the RFI screen displays the values of the requested customer information to be shared with the app (for example, Jone Doe, [j](mailto:bmsith@roku.com)[on.doe@emailaddress.com](mailto:on.doe@emailaddress.com)).  
  
By default, this flag is set to false, which means that the default RFI screen for the region is used. For example, in the US, the RFI screen displays the type of customer information being requested (email address, name, and so on).  
  
This flag has no effect if the context field is set to "signin" (the RFI sign-in screen always displays the customer information values).  
  
**Example**:  

    store = CreateObject("roChannelStore")
    
    ' Doesn't show user data in dialog unless necessary in he user's region.
    userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email,firstname,lastname,gender,birth")
    ' Show user data values in dialog.
    userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email,firstname,lastname,gender,birth", {context: "signup", forceShowData: true})
    ' forceShowData currently has no effect in signin context, as the shared data is always shown.
    userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email", {context: "signin", forceShowData: false})
    

#### Return Value

An roAssociativeArray containing the Roku account information passed in the method.

> For authenticated free and AVOD apps that are not enrolled in the [Roku Partner Payouts Program](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/partner-payouts.md), a limited set of account information may be requested and returned:

*   **Sign-up RFI screen**: email, phone, and zip.
*   **Sign-in RFI screen**: email and phone.

#### Sign-up example

    store = CreateObject("roChannelStore")
    
    ' Request user's email, phone, first name, and last name for sign-up
    userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email, phone, firstname, lastname")
    

#### Sign-in example

    store = CreateObject("roChannelStore")
    
    ' Request user's email for sign-in
    userData = store.GetPartialUserData("email", {context: "signin"})
