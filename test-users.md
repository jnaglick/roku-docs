Creating test users
===================

Test users can make in-app purchases free-of-charge for testing purposes. This is useful for testing the Roku Pay integration in an app.

> In order for a test user to make free in-app purchases on an app:
> 
> *   The test user must be associated with the app being tested.
> *   The test user's Roku account must be linked to the Roku device on which the app is installed.

Viewing and voiding transactions
--------------------------------

You can view all the transactions made by test users on your apps. You can also void all the transactions made by the test user on a specific to re-test the purchase workflows on that app with that test user. To view and void the transactions of a test user, follow these steps:

1.  Under the **Transactions** column in the test user's row, click **View**.

2.  The **Test user transaction** page lists each transaction made by the test user per app, including the purchase date, app name, transaction ID (used by the Roku Pay Web Service API for validating, refunding, and canceling purchases), and product name.

3.  To void the transactions made by the test user on a specific app, click **Void transactions**. All transactions made by the test user on that app are permanently deleted. The transaction IDs of the voided transactions are not accessible via the Roku Pay Web Service API.
