============

The roInput component sends the roInputEvent with the following predicates that indicate its valid event types:

Supported methods
-----------------

### isInput() as Boolean

Checks if an input event was received. This method returns true if an input event was received; otherwise, it returns false.

### GetInfo() as Object

Returns an roAssociativeArray describing the input event, which may be one of the following values:

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| type | string | The type of event, which may be one of the following values:<br><br>*   **transport**. The app received a voice request to control the playback of content or select a user from a profile selection screen. |
| id  | LongInteger | The unique ID associated with the generated transport event |
| command | string | The type of command:<br><br>*   "action" (). Indicates that the app has received an utterance matching a name or word previously registered with the [roAppManager.SetVoiceActionStrings()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifappmanager.md#setvoiceactionstringsactions-as-object-as-void) method.<br>*   "select" (). Indicates that the app has received a command for selecting an item via an ordinal number.<br>*   "forward"<br>*   "next"<br>*   "pause"<br>*   "play"<br>*   "replay"<br>*   "resume"<br>*   "rewind"<br>*   "seek"<br>*   "stop"<br>*   "startover"<br>*   "nowplaying"<br>*   "skip"<br>*   "shuffle"<br>*   "loop"<br>*   "like"<br>*   "dislike" |
| direction | string | For the "seek" transport command only. Specifies the direction of the seek command, which may be "forward" or "backward". |
| duration | string | For the "seek" transport command only. Specifies the number of seconds to skip forward or backward. |
| text | string | If the **type** is set to "transport" and the **command** is set to "action", this field contains the utterance matching the name or word previously registered for the app with the [roAppManager.SetVoiceActionStrings()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifappmanager.md#setvoiceactionstringsactions-as-object-as-void) method. |
| ordinal | string | If the **type** is "transport" and the **command** is "select", this field includes a numerical value that corresponds to the ordinal number spoken by the user. Values may range between 1â€“6 (one-base indexing is used). |
