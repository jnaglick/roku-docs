*   Deployed to devices on Roku OS 9.4 and above

### Version 2.14 – 12/2020

*   New [`enableInPodStitching(isIPS as Boolean)`](/docs/developer-program/advertising/raf-api.md#enableinpodstitchingisips-as-boolean) method brings benefits from [CSAS API](/docs/developer-program/advertising/csas.md) to apps using the classic CSAI [showAds()](/docs/developer-program/advertising/raf-api.md#showadsads-as-object-ctx-as-object-view-as-object-as-boolean) by stitching together multiple video clips within a single ad break (no buffering between ads)

    *   Fix regression of [fireRokuMarketingPixel()](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/tracking-signup-abandonment.md#integrating-the-raf-firerokumarketingpixel-method-in-the-signup-workflow) not URL-encoding its arguments
    *   Fix errors on bad metadata (e.g. when parsing VAST, getting a single ad with yet having fallback\_index>0)

*   Interactive ads improvements
*   Bug fixes and performance improvements
*   Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.1 and above

### Version 2.9 – 06/2019

*   Added a [ROKU\_ADS\_LOCALE macro](/docs/developer-program/advertising/integrating-roku-advertising-framework.md#url-parameter-macros) which returns current locale in same format as [roDeviceInfo.getCurrentLocale()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdeviceinfo.md#getcurrentlocale-as-string) (e.g. "en\_US", "es\_ES")
*   Library manifests internally [rsg\_version=1.2](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/channel-manifest.md#special-purpose-attributes), which decreases memory use when RAF is included in complex apps. Note this is independent from the application-level _manifest_ file, where you may separately declare _rsg\_version=1.2_ (or assume the default 1.1 \[the default is now 1.2 as of Roku OS 9.3\])
*   New interactive ad features
*   Improved diagnostics. Of note, when detected a URL with invalid characters, RAF would print a warning:

    [RAF.err] roUrlTransfer.setURL("some invalid URL") rejected argument - invalid chars? (space and "<>\^`{|} must be %-encoded)
    

*   Bug fixes and performance improvements
*   Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.1 and above

### Version 2.8 – 04/2019

*   New interactive ad units

*   Deployed to devices with Roku OS 9.0 and above

### Version 2.6 – 10/2018

*   RAF now shows test ads _only_ in side-loaded ("dev") and unpublished apps.
*   Added "In-Pod Stitching" capability for client-side ad-inserted (CSAI) apps, which provides an improved user experience that can eliminate buffering between multiple ads in an ad break. This can be enabled by developers for evaluation, and can by enabled in eligible production apps without the need for re-publishing.
*   Improved RAF diagnostic messages
*   Bug fixes and performance improvements
*   Deployed to devices with Roku OS 8.1 and above

### Version 2.5 – 05/2018

*   Major rework of RAF's diagnostic output to [BrightScript console](/docs/developer-program/debugging/debugging-channels.md#accessing-the-debug-console)
    
    *   Warning messages (prefixed with "\[RAF.err\]") are always printed for known potential problems. Note that these are just additional diagnostics - they do not change the library's behavior, as compared to previous versions.
    *   Substantially more information is printed when in setDebugOutput(true) mode: method call arguments and return values, [URL macros](/docs/developer-program/advertising/integrating-roku-advertising-framework.md#url-parameter-macros) expansion, ad XML/parsed, etc.
*   New interactive templates by BrightLine/Innovid
*   Deployed to devices with Roku OS 8.0 and above

    *   Improve forecasting by only resolving ad requests for wrapped creative renditions that are placed into ad slots

*   Correct pod-specific tracking for ad pods in server-stitched streams: PodComplete, PodStart
*   Disallow re-rendering of ad pod when pod cache has been updated while rendering the pod (e.g., for TrueX ads)
*   Re-purpose "Expand" and "Collapse" ad tracking to refer to microsite interactions for Innovid ads, which do not generally have a separate CompanionAd tag in the VAST representation for these additional tracking events
*   Ignore replicaId values when specified in SmartXML ad slots, since these always refer to the first replica

*   Prioritize MP4 over HLS ad creatives as HLS can take longer than the length of an ad to settle on an acceptable playback bitrate
*   Add support for TrueX ad experience and parse new TrueX VAST extensions
*   Invalidate rendering of current ad pod if pod cache has been updated
*   Parse "special" wrapped URLs inside <asset> tag in SmartXML
