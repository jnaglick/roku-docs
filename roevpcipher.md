roEVPCipher
===========

The EVP Cipher component provides an interface to the OpenSSL EVP library of symmetric cipher commands. The EVP library provides a high-level interface to cryptographic functions to implement digital "envelopes".

These commands allow data to be encrypted or decrypted using various block and stream ciphers using keys based on passwords or explicitly provided.

Some of the ciphers do not have large keys and others have security implications if not used correctly. A beginner is advised to just use a strong block cipher in CBC mode such as bf or des3. All the block ciphers normally use PKCS#5 padding also known as standard block padding. If padding is disabled then the input data must be a multiple of the cipher block length.
