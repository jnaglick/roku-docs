roSocketAddress
===============

The roSocketAddress is used by the roStreamSocket and roDataGramSocket components for TCP and UDP traffic respectively.

This object is created without any arguments:

`CreateObject("roSocketAddress")`

Methods in [ifSocketAddress](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsocketaddress.md "ifSocketAddress") are used to assign an IP address to the object. roSocketAddress currently supports only IPV4 addresses.
