Supported methods
-----------------

### GetData() as Integer

Returns the description of the speech, which may be one of the following values:

| ID  | Interpretation |
| --- | --- |
| 0   | Started speech |
| 1   | Speech has completed |
| 2   | Speech has been interrupted/flushed |
| 4   | Current language has been changed |
| 5   | Current voice has been changed |
| 6   | Speech rate has been changed |
| 7   | Speech volume has been changed |

### GetInfo() as Object

Returns an associative array with the following key-value pairs, depending the value returned by the [GetData()](/docs/references/brightscript/events/rotexttospeechevent.md#getinfo-as-object "GetData()") method:

| Key | Type | Value |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Enabled | Boolean | If GetData() returned 3, indicates the enabled/disabled status of text to speech |
| Language | String | If GetData() returned 4, indicates the new language |
| Voice | String | If GetData() returned 5, indicates the new voice |
| Rate | Integer | If GetData() returned 6, indicates the new speech rate |
| Volume | Integer | If GetData() returned 7, indicates the new speech volume |

### GetIndex() as Integer

The text to speech service may be shared among any number of clients; therefore, the IDs returned to a given client are not necessarily contiguous. The value is only meaningful if [GetData()](/docs/references/brightscript/events/rotexttospeechevent.md#getinfo-as-object "GetData()") returned 0, 1 or 2; it returns 0 otherwise.

This method returns the ID of the speech as returned by either the [Say()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/iftexttospeech.md#saytext-as-string-as-integer "Say()")" or [Silence()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/iftexttospeech.md#silenceduration-as-integer-as-integer "Silence()") methods of the [ifTextToSpeech](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/iftexttospeech.md "ifTextToSpeech") interface.
