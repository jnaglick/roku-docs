First steps
===========

To get started building a Roku app, do the following:

*   **[Create a Roku customer account](https://my.roku.com/signup)**. This enables you to enroll in the Roku developer program. Make sure that the email address you use for your account is one that you actively use and monitor. Roku frequently sends notifications that require you to take action (for example, to maintain your account, keep your app in the Streaming Store, or receive payouts).

*   **[Enroll in the Roku Developer program](https://developer.roku.com/enrollment/standard)**. This provides you with access to the [Roku Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer), which is used for creating, testing, and publishing apps.

*   **[Get a Roku device](https://www.roku.com/products/players)**. You can purchase a Roku device from [Roku.com](http://roku.com/), your local electronics retailer, or a second-hand marketplace.

*   **[Activate developer mode on your device](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/developer-setup.md)**. This enables you run sample apps on your device to help you learn Roku development and being running and testing your own apps.
