Controlling screen layout
=========================

Screen element layout is accomplished in several different ways in SceneGraph applications:

*   setting the `translation` fields of nodes or groups of nodes
*   controlling the z-order of the renderable nodes in SceneGraph trees to place nodes over or under each other
*   controlling the parent-child relationship of renderable nodes in SceneGraph trees, to allow grouping of several renderable nodes together
*   grouping renderable nodes together using the **Group** and **LayoutGroup** node classes

More complex SceneGraph node classes, such as the list and grid node classes, automatically control the spacing and layout of the items in the node. Many times, this layout control is configured in special data bindings for the node, and you can configure the layout by reading the layout data from XML or JSON files on your server.
