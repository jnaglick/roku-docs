Reads the specified file into the Byte Array. Any data currently in the Byte Array is discarded.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| path | String | The path to the file to be read. |

Slice(\[start\_pos as Integer\[, end\_pos as Integer\]\]) As Object
-------------------------------------------------------------------

#### Description

Returns a new array object with a shallow copy of the specified portion of the array.

The **start\_pos** and **end\_pos** fields specify the 0-based indices of items in the array, where the **end\_pos** field represents the position **past** the last element to be copied.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| start\_pos | Integer | The 0-based index of first element to copy. A negative index specifies an offset from the end of the array. The default value is 0. |
| end\_pos | Integer | The 0-based index past last element to copy. A negative index indicates an offset from the end of the array. The default value is the array length. |

#### Example

    '          0   1   2   3   4   5
    byteArr = [99, 26, 26, 36, 42]
    
    ' get the 3rd (index 2) and subsequent elements
    byteArr2 = byteArr.Slice(2)
    ? FormatJSON(byteArr2)
    ' => [26,36,42]
    
    ' get the 2nd (index 1) through 3rd (index 2) elements
    byteArr2 = byteArr.Slice(1, 3)
    ? FormatJSON(byteArr2)
    ' => [26,26]
    
    ' get the last 2 elements
    byteArr2 = byteArr.Slice(-2)
    ? FormatJSON(byteArr2)
    ' => [36,42]
    
    ' empty range
    byteArr2 = byteArr.Slice(1, 1)
    ? FormatJSON(byteArr2)
    ' => []
