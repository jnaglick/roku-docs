roInput
=======

An roInput object can be used to receive events sent from a network client using the External Control Protocol (ECP), as described in [External Control API](/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/external-control-api.md "External Control API").

> The [supports\_input\_launch manifest flag](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/channel-manifest.md#launch-requirement-attributes) must be set for channels to accept deep linking parameters when already running. This flag enables deep linking into content without relaunching the app. See the [Deep Linking sample app](https://github.com/rokudev/deep-Linking-samples) for how to use roInput to handle deep links into content while the app is already running.

Refer to [External Control Service Commands](/docs/developer-program/dev-tools/external-control-api.md#external-control-service-commands "External Control Service Commands") for information about the ECP input command.

This object is created without any arguments:

`CreateObject("roInput")`

**Example**

The following prints information received from an external device in JSON format. If the external device sends the following input command:

    curl -d '' '<roku_target_device>:8060/input?my_event=My%20Test&x=100&y=200&action=start'
    

The following will be printed:

    {"action":"start","my_event":"My Test","x":"100","y":"200"}
    

**roInput Example**

    msgPort = CreateObject("roMessagePort")
    
    input = CreateObject("roInput")
    input.SetMessagePort(msgPort)
    
    print "Waiting for messages..."
    while true
      msg = wait(0, msgPort)
      if type(msg) = "roInputEvent"
        if msg.IsInput()
          info = msg.GetInfo()
          print "Received input: "; FormatJSON(info)
        end if
      end if
    end while
