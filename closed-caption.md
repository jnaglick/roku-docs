Closed caption
==============

The Roku platform supports the following closed caption formats:

*   SMPTE-TT
*   EIA-608/708
*   WebVTT

Overview
--------

SMPTE-TT uses TTML formatted data either in an external file or embedded into the video stream to carry the caption text, timing, and format information. With EIA-608/708, caption information can only be embedded into the video stream. Adding support for either of these formats to your app is straightforward. SMPTE-TT and EIA-608 caption formats are not supported on legacy Roku platforms where the device is running Roku OS version 3.1. These platforms are limited to the use of SRT subtitles.

Closed caption tracks specification
-----------------------------------

Use the **SubtitleTracks** [content metadata](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md) property to specify the language, description, and track name for each subtitle track. Do not use the **SubtitleConfig** property unless you are overriding the caption track that is automatically selected based on user caption language preference. When specifying a track in SubtitleConfig, be sure to also specify it in SubtitleTracks so that the language and description are clear. Omitting the description will cause the UI to display the language in the closed caption menu. A description should at least contain the language.

See the [Video node documentation](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md#closed-caption-fields) for additional fields related to closed captioning.

Certification requirements
--------------------------

### Packaged control settings

In accordance with our certification requirements, Roku’s Video node automatically handles:

*   closed captioning,
*   language selection, and
*   instant replay

![roku815px - CCSupport](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/CCSupport.png "CCSupport")

Unless the app overrides it, all Roku players will launch an **Options overlay menu** when the ![roku815px - CCSupport2](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/CCSupport2.png "CCSupport2")key is pressed during playback of full-screen videos.

However, this only works if the app does not have its [OnKeyEvent()](/docs/references/scenegraph/component-functions/onkeyevent.md) handler fired, and the **[Video node](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md)** is playing full screen and setFocus is enabled i.e., the Video node is in focus, as displayed in the following code example:

    sub init()
        m.top.setFocus(true)
        setVideo()
    end sub
    

**Note:** When a full-screen video is playing, the user will expect the \* key to work as expected. The app must not override it in cases where there are no other UI elements showing with associated actions for the \* key.

### Custom control settings

#### Certification requirements

Per Roku's [certification requirements](/docs/developer-program/certification/certification.md#4-channel-operation) Apps must support the following closed captioning settings in the Options menu: On, Off, On instant replay, and On mute (Roku TVs only).

For VOD content, apps must synchronize the captions with the audio.

#### Recommendations

*   Apps should provide all available closed captioning tracks, but do not need to handle track selection. The Roku OS selects a closed caption track based on the preferred caption language selection in the system preferences. When the selected language is not available, it defaults to the system's UI language.
    
*   The global **closedCaptionMode** method of the [Video node](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md) object is how you turn on and off closed captioning of the current playing video. The global settings can be read and set in the [roDeviceInfo](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifdeviceinfo.md) object. These affect the same system setting. Whenever the user switches on/off closed caption, it is expected that the global setting will be adjusted accordingly. Therefore setting the global setting every time you adjust a local setting is required.
    
*   The **audio track** and the **subtitle track** (for Multilanguage subtitles) can be set using the **VideoNode.audioTrack** and **VideoNode.subtitleTrack** respectively. The available tracks can be found with **VideoNode.availableAudioTracks** and **VideoNode.availableSubtitleTracks**. Another useful item is **rodeviceinfo.GetCurrentLocale**, which returns the current locale set on the device, which is based on the user's language setting.
    
*   If you are using the **roVideoScreen** or **roVideoPlayer**, you should be rewriting your application in **[SceneGraph](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/core-concepts.md)** as the older technologies are being dropped from the Roku OS.
    

### Star button

**Important notes about \* button**

All Roku devices handle the \* button.

The options overlay slides in whenever the \* button is pressed, the Video node is in focus, and the OnKeyEvent() handler is fired. When the Video node is not in focus, the options overlay does not slide in and the OnKeyEvent() handler is fired.

### Instant replay button

![roku815px - CCSupport3](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/CCSupport3.png "CCSupport3")

Similarly, for closed captioning, Roku recommends that you allow us to handle use of the instant replay button ![roku815px - CCSupport4](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/CCSupport4.png "CCSupport4") in the firmware itself. However, if you decide to override our built-in functionality, then your app must offer equal levels of functionality.

While playing video, pressing will move the play head back 10–25 seconds and resume playing. If the closed caption setting is set to “On-replay,” then closed captioning will appear for the duration of time until playback reaches the position where the user presses \*.

The replay button events can be received like any other [events](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/event-loops.md).

The Roku OS automatically enables the closed captions during the replay interval.

Pressing \* multiple times should move the play head and changes the demarcation point accordingly (only the most recent replay applies). For live linear content, you can stop seeking back if the play head hit the end of the live window.

### Additional considerations

Although **Closed captioning** and **Subtitles** are two different things, and server separate functions, both functions reside within the [Video node](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md).

One important consideration with the rules outlined above is that the [Roku Advertising Framework](/docs/developer-program/advertising/roku-advertising-framework.md) (RAF) will turn off **trickplay** and the **instant replay** for the duration of an ad. If you are using server-stitched ads, you must disable this with the [**Video.enableUI** field](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md#ui-fields).

![roku815px - Roku-remote-control-4-button](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/Roku-remote-control-4-button.png "Roku-remote-control-4-button")

Finally, note that the **fast forward**, **rewind**, and the **left** & **right** arrows on the direction pad should move the play head.

Use the [**Video.notificationInterval**](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md#trickplay-fields) field to simplify the app logic around this. This field lets you set the number of seconds that observers of the position field should receive notifications.

Non-legacy platforms
--------------------

The non-legacy Roku platforms also include a closed captions setting menu (under the Settings menu option) which allows Roku users to control how closed captions are rendered on the device. These settings let users turn closed captions on and off, and to customize various caption properties such as font size, color, etc. These settings are available to developers via APIs defined on the roDeviceInfo component. It is not necessary for apps to implement their own closed caption settings UI, as the state of the global settings can be queried using these new API functions. Details of the global closed caption settings APIs can be found [here](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md).

SMPTE-TT
--------

Roku has partially implemented the SMPTE-TT TTML spec that can be referenced here: [http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/). Roku makes no claim of even minimal compliance. The link to the TTML spec is provided only for discussion on features we have implemented. Roku's TTML parser will recognize regions, styles, and spans. The captions are recognized as "p" paragraph elements with a "begin" and "end" time.

Roku's caption rendering will always use a build in Gotham font regardless of any font specified in the TTML. Likewise, some font styles may also be ignored. However, the Roku caption rendering will make the best guess effort at choosing the corresponding font size in the system Gotham font using the specified font size in the TTML.

Roku's TTML parser recognizes sufficient stylings to render colors, positions, and alignments either on an absolute or percentage offset. Namespaces do not cause a problem for the parser, but they are not validated either.

The Roku TTML parser recognizes the following elements from Section 7 of the TTML spec that specify the structure and principal content aspects of a document instance:

*   [**7.1.1:** tt](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#document-structure-vocabulary-tt)
    
*   [**7.1.2:** head](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#document-structure-vocabulary-head)
    
*   [**7.1.3:** body](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#document-structure-vocabulary-body)
    
*   [**7.1.4:** div](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#content-vocabulary-div)
    
*   [**7.1.5:** p](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#content-vocabulary-p)
    
*   [**7.1.6:** span](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#content-vocabulary-span)
    

The Roku TTML parser recognizes the following elements from Section 8 of the TTML spec that specify the structure and principal styling aspects of a document instance:

*   [**8.1.1** Styling](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#styling-vocabulary-styling)
    
*   [**8.1.2** Style](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#styling-vocabulary-style)
    

The Roku TTML parser recognizes the following styling elements from Section 8.2 of the TTML spec:

*   [**8.2.2** backgroundColor](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-backgroundColor)
    
*   [**8.2.3** color](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-color)
    
*   [**8.2.6** displayAlign](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-displayAlign)
    
*   [**8.2.7** extent](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-extent)
    
*   [**8.2.9** fontSize](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-fontSize)
    
*   [**8.2.14** origin](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-origin)
    
*   [**8.2.18** textAlign](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#style-attribute-textAlign)\*\*
    

The Roku TTML parser recognizes the following layout elements from Section 9 of the TTML spec:

*   [**9.1.1** layout](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#layout-vocabulary-layout)
    
*   [**9.1.2** region](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#layout-vocabulary-region)
    

The Roku TTML parser recognizes the following basic timing attributes for use with timed elements:

*   [**10.2.1** begin](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#timing-attribute-begin)
    
*   [**10.2.2** end](http://www.w3.org/TR/ttaf1-dfxp/#timing-attribute-end)\*\*
    

EIA-608
-------

Roku supports EIA-608 closed caption data (analog TV format) encapsulated within a EIA-708 container (digital TV) in an H.264 elementary stream and HEVC. EIA-608 captions are delivered as part of the video stream itself. One benefit of this caption format is that there can be multiple “channels” of captions within the stream. These separate channels could be used for different languages, for example, English captions on one channel, Spanish on another, and so forth.

To render EIA-608 captions from within BrightScript, simply set the TrackName attribute of the SubtitleConfig content metadata parameter to “eia608/n” where n is the caption channel. Also, add it to SubtitleTracks to specify the correct language.

WebVTT
------

Roku supports WebVTT captions if embedded in HLS streams or manifests. As with the other closed caption formats, an app specifies WebVTT captions in the SubtitleTracks metadata. The **TrackName** property is set to "webvtt/track" where **track** specifies the index of the caption track to render.

Roku also supports WebVTT captions in DASH as per the DASH-IF IOP guidelines. The WebVTT content can be specified as mimetype “application/mp4” and codecs parameter “wvtt” for Fragmented MP4 content. For WebVTT captions carried as text, mimetype “text/vtt” is supported.
