roFileSystem
============

The roFilesystem component implements common filesystem inspection and modificationroutines.

All paths are matched case-insensitively, regardless of the case-sensitivity of the underlying filesystem. The supported character set is limited to only those characters supported by vfat filesystems (valid Windows characters). The usbplayer sample application is a good example of roFileSystem usage. USB devices with VFAT, NTFS, HFS, and HFS Plus filesystems are supported. The USB filesystems are currently mounted read only.

This object is created with no parameters:
