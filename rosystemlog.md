roSystemLog
===========

The roSystemLog component enables the application to receive events from the Roku Streaming Player that are intended for reporting errors and trends, rather than trigger a response to a user action.

All of the log event messages are sent to the roMessagePort that is registered on the [roSystemLogEvent](/docs/references/brightscript/events/rosystemlogevent.md "roSystemLogEvent") object. See roSystemLogEvent for details on the messages.

This object is created with no parameters:

`CreateObject("roSystemLog")`

The roSystemLog component requires specific Design Patterns in your BrightScript Application. Take care to:

*   Use one roMessagePort throughout the application (instead of creating a new roMessagePort for each screen).
*   Create one roSystemLog instance at startup that remains for the entire lifetime of the application.
*   Create the roSystemLog instance on the main thread (it cannot be created on a task thread).
*   Pass the global roMessagePort referenced in the first bullet point to SetMessagePort() on the roSystemLog component.
*   Enable the desired log types using EnableType().
*   Handle the [roSystemLogEvents](/docs/references/brightscript/events/rosystemlogevent.md "roSystemLogEvents") in all message loops.
