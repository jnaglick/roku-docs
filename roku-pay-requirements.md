-------------------------------------

| Requirement | Name | Description | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RP 2.1 | RFI screen | All authenticated transactional channels (SVOD, TVOD, and other subscription services) must use the [getUserData](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getuserdata) command to display a Request For Information (RFI) screen during the sign-up and sign-in workflows to enable customers to share their Roku account information with the channel.  <br>  <br>Only if the user declines the request, may channels require the customer to manually enter information other than a password. | *   [Signup requirements and best practices](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/signup-best-practices.md)<br>*   [Sign-in requirements and best practices](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/signin-best-practices.md) |

RP 3 Payment requirements
-------------------------

| Requirement | Name | Description | Documentation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| RP 3.1 | Product groups | Subscription services must create product groups in the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer) for any set of subscription products that the consumer should not be able to be subscribed to simultaneously.  <br>  <br>For example, if an channel has two in-channel products for the same monthly subscription but with different free trial durations, these two products must be added to the same product group to prevent the customer from paying for two separate monthly subscriptions | [In-channel purchases - Product groups](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md#adding-product-groups) |
| RP 3.2 | Multiple purchase protection | Channels must protect against multiple purchases of content or subscriptions through Roku Pay before passing new orders to the Streaming Store service.  <br>  <br>The Streaming Store service inherently protects against purchasing the same subscription code multiple times, but preventing, for example, the purchase of a free trial subscription and a non-free trial subscription must be done in the channel. | [In-channel purchases -Product Groups](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md#adding-product-groups) |
| RP 3.3 | Price changes | SVOD channels must provide 30-days notice to existing customers before changing the price of their service. | [In-channel purchases - Product pricing](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md#product-pricing) |
| RP 3.4 | In-channel product naming | Channels must name in-channel products so that the service being offered is clearly identifiable. The publisher must have full legal rights or consent for their in-channel product names and the rights to all trademarks and copyright expressions associated with the names. The in-channel product names may not include the name "Roku", text related to a trial or discount offer**,** or any profane, derogatory, or misleading language. | [In-channel purchases - Product basics](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md#product-basics) |

| RP 4.3 | Account-based entitlements | Channels must automatically entitle content or subscriptions purchased through Roku Pay across all devices tied to the purchasing Roku account.  <br>  <br>Channels can use the [getAllPurchases](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getallpurchases) API can upon launch to return the transactionID for an active subscription, and they can use an entitlement server to look up an account via a call to the [validate-transaction API](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/roku-web-service.md#validate-transaction). | *   [getPurchases ChannelStore API](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getuserdata)<br>*   [validate-transaction Roku Pay Web service API](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/roku-web-service.md#validate-transaction) |
| RP 4.4 | Abandonment tracking | All subscription services that have streamed more than an average of 5 million hours per month over the last three months (and new subscription services projected to reach the specified streaming hour threshold shortly after launch) must implement Roku Event Dispatcher (RED) in the signup workflow.  <br>  <br>Channels must fire a RED event upon loading each page within the signup flow and submission of the final page to help track where users are abandoning the process. This includes, but is not limited to, the following pages: landing, sign up, registration, device activation, subscription selection, payment, purchase confirmation, and cancellation.  <br>  <br>If the channel's sign-up flow is contained within a form that covers one or more pages, channels must fire a RED event when each element in the form is completed.

| RP 4.5 | Enhanced Subscription Recovery (churn mitigation) | All apps offering subscriptions must implement Enhanced Subscription Recovery to pass [certification](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/roku-pay-requirements.md#rp-4-authentication-and-entitlement-requirements) | [Enhanced Subscription Recovery](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/subscription-recovery/subscription-on-hold.md) |
