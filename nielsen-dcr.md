Implementing Nielsen Digital Content Ratings (DCR) measurement
==============================================================

Publishers can enable Digital Content Ratings (DCR) measurement on their Roku apps to understand their viewers' content consumption. Nielsen DCR provides publishers with analytics and reporting for the average audience, reach, frequency, gross rating point (GRP) and time spent metrics on the Roku platform.

Getting started
---------------

Onboarding and deploying Nielsen DCR entails the following steps:

1.  Contact your Nielsen Client Services representative.
2.  Your Nielsen Technical Account Manager (TAM) will provide an Application ID and integration support.
3.  [Integrate the Nielsen Cloud API](https://engineeringportal.nielsen.com/docs/DCR_Video_%26_Static_Roku_Cloud_API) to enable DCR measurement of your Roku apps.
4.  Your TAM will test your app application to ensure that the integration is functioning properly and all of the necessary data is present and triggered appropriately.
5.  Once your integration is in production, Nielsen will continue to test and monitor it to ensure that it is functioning correctly.
