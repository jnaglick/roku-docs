Program statements
==================

DIM name (dim1, dim2, …, dimK)
------------------------------

DIM ("dimension") is a statement that provides a short cut to creating roArray objects. It sets variable _name_ to type "roArray", and creates Arrays of Arrays as needed for multi-dimensional arrays. The dimension passed to Dim is the index of the maximum entry to be allocated (the array initial size = dimension+1); the array will be resized larger automatically if needed.

    Dim array[5]
    

Is the same as:

    array=CreateObject("roArray",6,true)
    

Note that x\[a,b\] is the same as x\[a\]\[b\].

     Dim c[5, 4, 6]
     For x = 1 To 5
        For y = 1 To 4
            For z = 1 To 6
                c[x, y, z] = k
                k = k + 1
            End for
        End for
     End for
    
    
     k=0
     For x = 1 To 5
        For y = 1 To 4
            For z = 1 To 6
                If c[x, y, z] <> k Then print"error" : Stop
                If c[x][y][z] <> k Then print "error": Stop
                k = k + 1
            End for
        End for
     End for
    

variable = expression
---------------------

Assigns a variable to a new value.

**Example**

    a$="a rose is a rose"
    b1=1.23
    x=x-z1
    

In each case, the variable on the left side of the equals sign is assigned the value of the constant or expression on the right side.

END
---

Terminates execution normally.

STOP
----

Interrupts execution return a STOP error. Invokes the debugger. Use "cont" at the debug prompt to continue execution, or "step" to single step.

GOTO label
----------

Transfers program control to the specified line number. GOTO _label_ results in an branch. A label is an identifier terminated with a colon, on a line by itself.

For example:

    mylabel:
    print "Anthony was here!"
    Goto mylabel
    

RETURN \[expression\]
---------------------

Used to return from a function back to the caller. If the function is not of type Void, return can return a value to the caller.

FOR counter = exp TO exp \[STEP exp\] / END FOR
-----------------------------------------------

Creates an iterative (repetitive) loop so that a sequence of program statements may be executed over and over a specified number of times. The general form is (brackets indicate optional material):  
FOR _counter-variable = initial value_ TO _final value_ \[STEP _increment_\]  
\[_program statements_\]  
END FOR  
In the FOR statement, _initial value, final value_ and _increment_ can be any expression. The first time the FOR statement is executed, these three are evaluated and the values are saved; if the variables are changed by the loop, it will have no effect on the loop's operation. However, the counter variable must not be changed or the loop will not operate normally. The first time the FOR statement is executed the counter is set to the "initial value" and to the type of "initial value".  
At the top of the loop, the counter is compared with the _final value_ specified in the FOR statement. If the counter is greater than the _final value_, the loop is completed and execution continues with the statement following the END FOR statement. (If _increment_ was a negative number, loop ends when counter is less than _final value_.) If the counter has not yet exceeded the _final value_, control passes to the first statement after the FOR statement.  
When program flow reaches the END FOR statement, the counter is incremented by the amount specified in the STEP _increment_. (If the _increment_ has a negative value, then the counter is actually decremented.) If STEP _increment_ is not used, an increment of 1 is assumed.

For example:

    For i=10 To 1 Step -1
        print i
    End For
    

"EXIT FOR" is used to exit a FOR block prematurely.

FOR EACH item IN object
-----------------------

The FOR EACH statement iterates through each item in any object that has an "ifEnum" interface (enumerator). The For block is terminated with a END FOR statement. The variable _item_ is set at the top of the loop to the next item in the object. Objects that are intrinsically ordered (like a List) are enumerated in order. Objects that have no intrinsic order (like AssociativeArray) are enumerated in apparent random order. It is okay to delete entries as you enumerate them.

"EXIT FOR" is used to exit a FOR block prematurely.  
The following objects can be enumerated: roList, roArray, roAssociativeArray, roMessagePort.

For example:

    aa = { joe: 10, fred: 11, sue:9 }
    
    For Each n In aa
        Print n;aa[n]
        aa.delete(n)
    End For
    

WHILE expression / EXIT WHILE / END WHILE
-----------------------------------------

The While loop executes until expression is false. The "exit while" statement can be used to terminate a while loop prematurely.

For example:

    k = 0
    while k = 0
        k = 1
        print "loop once".
    end while
    
    while true
        print "loop once"
        if k <> 0 then exit while
    end while
    

CONTINUE FOR / CONTINUE WHILE
-----------------------------

The "continue" statement terminates the execution of the statements in the current iteration of the loop, and continues execution of the loop with the next iteration

For example:

    fruits = ["orange", "lemon", "lime"]
    for each fruit in fruits
        if fruit = "lemon" then continue for
        ? fruit
    end for
    ...
    counter = 0
    while counter < 3
        if counter = 1 then
            counter++
            continue while
        end if
        ? counter
        counter++
    end while
    

TRY / CATCH variable / END TRY
------------------------------

Use to trap exceptions, which enables the implementation of error handling in BrightScript programs. Schematically, the syntax is as follows:

    TRY
        ' Zero or more statements ("TRY block")
    CATCH exception_object_variable_name
        ' Zero or more statements ("CATCH block")
    END TRY
    

> END TRY and ENDTRY are equivalent

The TRY block of statements is executed. If and only if an error occurs, the CATCH block of statements is executed, and the named variable is assigned the information about the triggering exception. If no error occurs during execution of the TRY block, the CATCH block is skipped.

> It is illegal to put a GOTO label within a TRY block (i.e., between TRY and CATCH). A GOTO label may exist exist between CATCH and END TRY, however.

The variable name specified as the _exception object_ in the CATCH clause must refer to a _simple variable_. It cannot be an array element, for example. The following are **not** legal as exception object references in the CATCH clause:

    CATCH                ' no object variable at all -- an object must always be specified
    CATCH someArray[23]  ' array element is bad exception object
    CATCH bill.ted       ' object field is bad exception object
    CATCH 22             ' literal constant is bad exception object
    CATCH a+wave         ' expression is bad exception object
    

Information about the exception is contained within an exception object that is assigned to the CATCH-clause variable. This exception object can contain the following elements:

| Name | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| number | Integer | The classic BrightScript error number |
| message | String | A textual interpretation of the error number |
| backtrace | roArray | A backtrace, normally, to the location (origin) of the problem, even if the exception is subsequently caught and "re-thrown." |
| rethrown | boolean | False: This is the first time that this exception has been caught. True: The exception has been caught and re-thrown; the backtrace is therefore _not_ to the location of the most recent THROW. |
| rethrow\_backtrace | roArray | A second backtrace, to the location of a re-thrown exception. |

A backtrace is an array of associative arrays, each of which includes at least the following elements:

| Name | Type | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| filename | String | The URI-formatted filename |
| line\_number | Integer | The line number within that file |
| function | String | The prototype/signature (name, arguments, return type) of the function |

**Example code**

The following example sends an error message, including the contents of the exception record, to the debug console.

    TRY
        PRINT 1/0
    CATCH e
        PRINT "Division failed: ", e
    END TRY
    

> TRY and CATCH are _not_ keywords in BrightScript. Programmers should treat them as reserved identifiers and avoid using them. In particular, legacy code that may already employ them as ordinary identifiers should be rewritten to use different identifiers instead.
> 
> TRY and CATCH were introduced into BrightScript with Roku OS version 9.4, and any app that uses them must declare a minimum OS version of 9.4 in the Package Upload Developer Dashboard page during app submission.

### Nested TRY/CATCH statements

TRY/CATCH statements can be nested within TRY or CATCH blocks, as needed. Here is an example:

    PRINT "Starting"
    x = "I'm not an array"
    TRY
        PRINT "x[0]*2=";x[0]*2
    CATCH e
        TRY
            PRINT "I think that failed because ";x[0];" isn't a number"
        CATCH e
            PRINT "Nope, I guessed wrong: ";e.message
        END TRY
    END TRY
    PRINT "Ending"
    

> The STOP statement produces an uncatchable error, consistent with its intended use in debugging.

THROW expression
----------------

Use the THROW statement to propagate an exception back to the caller of the present code.

The expression given in the THROW statement should evaluate to an exception object (or the equivalent associative array), as defined for TRY/CATCH. A single String is also acceptable as operand, however. In that case, BrightScript creates a default exception object, fills the `message` field with the supplied String, and sets the error number to `ERR_USER` (`&h28`).

> THROW is a keyword in BrightScript.
> 
> THROW was introduced into BrightScript with Roku OS version 9.4, and any app that uses it must declare a minimum OS version of 9.4 in the Package Upload Developer Dashboard page during app submission.

**Example code**

    FUNCTION reciprocal(x)
        RETURN 1/x
    END FUNCTION
    
    FUNCTION factorial(n)
        IF n < 0 THEN
            THROW "Cannot calculate negative factorial."
        ELSE IF n = 0 THEN
            RETURN 1
        ELSE
            RETURN n * factorial(n-1)
        END IF
    END FUNCTION
    
    SUB main()
        TRY
            PRINT reciprocal(0)
        CATCH e
            PRINT "reciprocal() failed: ", e.message
        END TRY
    
        PRINT factorial(-2) ' Error will be reported by BrightScript runtime/debugger
    END SUB
    

REM
---

Instructs the compiler to ignore the rest of the program line. This allows you to insert comments (REMarks) into your program for documentation. An ' (apostrophe) may be used instead of REM.

For example:

    Rem ** this remark introduces the program **
    ' this too is a remark
    

IF expression THEN statements \[ELSE statements\]
-------------------------------------------------

There are two forms of the IF THEN ELSE statement. The single line form (this one), and the multi-line or block form (see next section). The IF instructs the Interpreter to test the following _expression_. If the _expression_ is true, control will proceed to the statements immediately following the expression. If the expression is False, control will jump to the matching ELSE statement (if there is one) or down to the next program line.

For example:

    if x > 127 then print "out of range"
    If caveman = "fred" then print "flintstone" else print "rubble"
    

THEN is optional in the above and similar statements.

Block IF, ELSEIF, THEN, ENDIF
-----------------------------

The multi-line or block form of IF THEN ELSE is more flexible. It has the form:

     if BooleanExpression then
       statements
     elseif BooleanExpression then
       statements
     else
       statements
     end if
    

There may be any number of elseif statements, or there may be none. The else statement may also be omitted. "elseif" can also be written as two words: "else if".

For example:

    msg = wait(0, p)
    if type(msg) = "roVideoPlayerEvent" then
        if debug then print "video event"
        if msg.isFullResult()
            if debug then print "video finished"
            return 9
        end if
    else if type(msg) = "roUniversalControlEvent" then
        if debug then print "button press "; msg.GetInt()
        HandleButton(msg.GetInt())
    elseif msg = invalid then
        if debug print "timeout"
        return 6
    end if
    

PRINT item list
---------------

Prints an item or a list of items on the console. The items may be either strings, number, variables, or expressions. Objects that have an ifInt, ifFloat, or ifString interface may also be printed.

The items to be PRINTed may be separated by commas or semi-colons. If commas are used, the cursor automatically advances to the next print zone before printing the next item. If semi-colons are used, no space is inserted between the items printed.

Positive numbers are printed with a leading blank (instead of a plus sign); floating point numbers are printed with a trailing blank; and no blanks are inserted before or after strings.

For example:

    x=5:print 25; " is equal to"; x^2
     25 is equal to 25
    
    a$="string":print a$;a$,a$;" ";a$
    stringstring    string string
    
    print "zone 1","zone 2","zone 3","zone 4"
    zone 1          zone 2          zone 3          zone 4
    

> `?` is a short cut for the `print` statement. For example:
> 
>     x=5:? 25; " is equal to"; x^2
>     

Each print zone is 16 char wide. The cursor moves to the next print zone each time a comma is encountered.

    print "print statement #1 "; "print statement #2"
    
    Output: print statement #1 print statement #2
    

Semi-colons can be dropped in some cases. For example, this is legal:

    Print "this is a five " 5 "!!"
    

A trailing semi-colon over-rides the cursor-return so that the next PRINT begins where the last one left off. If no trailing punctuation is used with print, the cursor drops down to the beginning of the next line.

A few examples of printing enumerable objects:

**Printing Enumerable Objects**

    Print {}
    ' this will print: <Component: roAssociativeArray> =  { }
    
    Print {a:1}
    ' this will print: <Component: roAssociativeArray> =  { a: 1 }
    
    Print []
    ' this will print: <Component: roArray> = [ ]
    
    Print [5]
    ' this will print: <Component: roArray> = [ 5 ]
    

**TAB (expression)**  
Moves the cursor to the specified position on the current line (modulo the width of your console if you specify TAB positions greater than the console width). TAB may be used several times in a PRINT list.

    print tab(5)"tabbed 5";tab(25)"tabbed 25"
    

No punctuation is required after a TAB modifier. Numerical expressions may be used to specify a TAB position. TAB cannot be used to move the cursor to the left. If the cursor is beyond the specified position, the TAB is ignored.

**POS ( x )**  
Returns a number from 0 to window width, indicating the current cursor position on the cursor. Requires a "dummy argument" (any numeric expression).

    print tab(40) pos(0) 'prints 40 at position 40
    print "these" tab(pos(0)+5)"words" tab(pos(0)+5)"are"; tab(pos(0)+5)"evenly" tab(pos(0)+5)"spaced"
    

FUNCTION(\[parameter \[= default\] AS type, …\]) AS type / END FUNCTION
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

A function is declared using the function statement. In parentheses, one or more optional parameters to be passed may be declared. The return type of the function may also be declared. If the parameter or return type are not declared, they are assumed to be "dynamic" Intrinsic types are passed by value (a copy is made). Objects are passed by reference. Parameters can be of type:

*   Integer
*   Float
*   Double
*   Boolean
*   String
*   Object
*   Dynamic
*   Function

In addition to the above types, the return type can be:

*   Void

Each parameter can have a default value, which is used if the parameter is not included in the call. The default parameter is declared by following the parameter name with an equal sign and the default value. If any parameter has a default value, then each following parameter must also have a default value. In the following examples, the functions add2 and add3 can be called with either one or two parameters.

For example:

    Function cat(a, b)
        Return a+b 'a, b could be numbers or strings
    End Function
    
    Function five() as Integer
        Return 5
    End function
    
    Function add(a as Integer, b as Integer) As Integer
        Return a+b
    End function
    
    
    Function add2(a as Integer, b=5 as Integer) As Integer
        Return a+b
    End Function
    
    
    Function add3(a as Integer, b=a+5 as Integer) as Integer
        Return a+b
    End Function
    

Functions have their own scope.

The statement "Sub" can be used instead of "function" as a shortcut to a function of Void return Type.

If a function is called from an associative array, then a local variable "m" is set to the AssociativeArray that the function is stored in.

For example:

    Sub main()
        obj={
            add: add
            a: 5
            b: 10
        }
    
        obj.add()
        print obj.result
    End Sub
    
    
    Function add() as void
        m.result = m.a + m.b
    End Function
    

If a function is not called from an AssociativeArray, then its "m" is set to an AssociativeArray that is global to the module, and persists across calls.

Anonymous functions
-------------------

A function is anonymous if it does not have a name. Note that Anonymous Functions do not currently create closures. An Anonymous Function can be declared like this:

    myfunc = Function (a, b)
        Return a+b
    End Function
    
    print myfunc(1,2)
    

They can be used with associative array literals like this:

    q = {
        starring : Function(o, e)
            str = e.GetBody()
            print "Starring: " + str
            toks = box(str).tokenize(",")
            For Each act In tok
                actx = box(act).trim()
                If actx <> "" Then
                    print "Actor: [" + actx + "]"
                    o.Actors.Push(actx)
                End If
            End For
            Return 0
        End Function
    }
    
    q.starring(myobj, myxml)
