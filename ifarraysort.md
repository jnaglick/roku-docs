Supported methods
-----------------

### Sort(flags as String = "") as Void

#### Description

Performs a stable sort on an array.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| flags | Dynamic | Items are arbitrarily grouped by comparable type of number or string, and are sorted within the group with a logical comparison.  <br>  <br>If "r" is included in flags, a reverse sort is performed. If "i" is included in flags, a case-insensitive sort is performed. If invalid flags are specified, the sort is not performed. |

#### Examples

        a=[3, 1, 2] 
        a.Sort()
        print a  
        REM sets the array to [1, 2, 3]
    
        a=[3, 1, 2.5] 
        a.Sort("r")  REM reverse order sort
        print a
        REM sets the array to [3, 2.5, 1]
    
        a=["cat", "DOG", "bee"] 
        a.Sort()  REM case-sensitive sort by default
        print a
        REM sets the array to ["DOG", "bee", "cat"]
    
        a=["cat", "DOG", "bee"]  
        a.Sort("i")  REM case-insensitive sort
        print a
        REM sets the array to ["bee", "cat", "DOG"]
    
        a=["cat", "DOG", "bee"]  
        a.Sort("ir")  REM case-insensitive, reverse order sort
        print a
        REM sets the array to ["DOG", "cat", "bee"]
    

### SortBy(fieldName as String, flags as String = "") as Void

#### Description

Performs a stable sort of an array of associative arrays by value of a common field.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| fieldName | String | The field to be used for sorting. |
| flags | Dynamic | Items are arbitrarily grouped by comparable type of number or string, and are sorted within the group with a logical comparison.  <br>  <br>If "r" is included in flags, a reverse sort is performed. If "i" is included in flags, a case-insensitive sort is performed. If invalid flags are specified, the sort is not performed. |

#### Examples

        a=[ {id:3, name:"Betty"}, {id:1, name:"Carol"}, {id:2, name:"Anne"} ]
        a.SortBy("name") 
        REM sets the array to [ {id:2, name:"Anne"}, {id:3, name:"Betty"}, {id:1, name:"Carol"} ]
        a.SortBy("id") 
        REM sets the array to [ {id:1, name:"Carol"}, {id:2, name:"Anne"}, {id:3, name:"Betty"} ]
        a.SortBy("name", "r")  REM reverse order sort
        REM sets the array to [ {id:1, name:"Carol"}, {id:3, name:"Betty"}, {id:2, name:"Anne"} ]
    

### Reverse() as Void

#### Description

Reverses the order of elements in an array.

#### Example

        a=[1, "one", 2, "two"] 
        a.Reverse() 
        REM sets the array to ["two", 2, "one", 1]
