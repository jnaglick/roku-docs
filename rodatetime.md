roDateTime
==========

The roDateTime provides an interface to obtain the current date/time for the player and manipulate date/times.

This component provides several options for obtaining attributes about the date/time. All times are GMT unless they are converted to the system timezone with a call to the method: toLocalTime().

This object is created with no parameters:

`CreateObject("roDateTime")`

The date/time of the object is set to the current system time when the object is created. The date/time represented by the object can be changed by calling Mark(), FromSeconds(), or FromISO8601String().

**Example**

    date = CreateObject("roDateTime")
    print "The date is now "; date.AsDateString("long-date")
