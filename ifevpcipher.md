| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [roEVPCipher](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roevpcipher.md "roEVPCipher") | The EVP Cipher component provides an interface to the OpenSSL EVP library of symmetric cipher commands |

Supported methods
-----------------

### Setup(encrypt as Boolean, format as String, key as String, iv as String, padding as Integer) as Integer

#### Description

Configures and initializes a new cipher context.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| encrypt | Boolean | True for encryption; false for decryption |
| format | String | Cipher format string, from openssl, listed at roEVPCipher |
| key | String | A hex-encoded key |
| iv  | String | A hex-encoded initialization vector, which can be an empty string |
| padding | Integer | 1 to use standard padding; 0 for no padding) |

#### Return Value

Returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure.

### Reinit() as Integer

#### Description

Reinitializes an existing cipher context. This can be called to reuse an existing [roEVPCipher](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roevpdigest.md "roEVPCipher") object to encrypt new data

#### Return Value

Returns 0 on success or non-zero on failure.

### Process(bytes as Object) as Object

#### Description

Processes the included [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md) containing encrypted/decrypted data.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bytes | Object | An [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md) containing data that is encrypted or decrypted. |

#### Return Value

An [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md "roByteArray") containing the result.

#### Example

      x = evp.Process(bytes)
    

is equivalent to

      evp.Reinit()
      x = evp.Update(bytes)
      x = x + evp.Final()
    

### Update(bytes as Object) as Object

#### Description

Updates the included [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md) containing encrypted/decrypted data.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| bytes | Object | An [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md) containing data that is encrypted or decrypted. |

#### Return Value

An [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md "roByteArray") containing a subset of the result. Some or all of the result may not be returned until the next call to Update().

### Final() as Object

#### Description

Signals that all data has been submitted by previous calls to Update().

#### Return Value

The last remaining encrypted or decrypted bytes.
