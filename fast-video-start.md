Fast video start
================

Fast video start is a user interface design technique for apps that reduces the amount of time apparent to the user that the video stream buffers before actual playback begins.

All digital video requires some time after a video is selected to begin playback, and video files streamed over HTTP add network transfer rates to this buffering time. Typically, to play back a video, the content meta-data for a video is set, and an roSpringboardScreen component (or equivalent) is shown to the user with descriptive details about the video. When the user actually selects the video for playback, calling play() on the roVideoScreen or roVideoPlayer object shows a "loading" screen before actual playback, while the video stream is buffering. **"Fast start"** allows this video stream buffering to take place _before_ the user has actually selected a video for playback, by initiating the buffering process while the user is deciding whether to play a certain video.

To implement fast video start, you create a roVideoScreen or roVideoPlayer component prior to showing a roSpringboardScreen (or equivalent) for a video, and call Prebuffer(). The video stream will buffer for as long as the user is reading the description of the video on the screen. Then when the user actually selects the video for playback, call play(). Depending on how much time the user spent reading the video description, the video may begin actual playback immediately, or with a much reduced amount of time that the "loading" screen is shown.

Calling Prebuffer() starts buffering the video specified by a previous SetContentList() (for roVideoPlayer) or SetContent() (for roVideoScreen) call. If the video has not been specified in one of these ways, calling Prebuffer() has no effect.

> SceneGraph apps use the [Video node](/docs/references/scenegraph/media-playback-nodes/video.md) control field prebuffer option to implement Fast Video Start. See [Fast start media playback](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/playing-videos.md#fast-start-media-playback) for information on implementing Fast Video Start in a SceneGraph app.

roVideoPlayer use cases
-----------------------

### Prebuffer before playback

The following code demonstrates this use case.

    port = CreateObject( "roMessagePort" )
    
    content = {
      Stream: { url : "http://play.this.url.com/video.m3u8" }
      StreamFormat: "hls"
    }
    
    ' First   create the player and set content list
    player = CreateObject( "roVideoPlayer" )
    player.setMessagePort( port )
    player.setContentList( content )
    ' Prebuffer the data
    player.Prebuffer()
    
    ' Show the content springboard screen and wait for an event
    ' from user asking to playback the content
    while true
      msg = wait( 0, port)
      ' break out if correct message is received
    end while
    
    ' Start   playback now
    player.play()
    
    ' Handle user requests here
    while true
      msg = wait( 0, port )
      ' process msg here
    end while
    

For this use case, the video player event handling has to occur in two event loops, one while prebuffering from a content springboard screen, and one during playback. This is necessary since the firmware may encounter errors during prebuffer that should be handled by the app.

### Playback canceled after/while prebuffering

If the app calls Stop() while prebuffering, prebuffered video data is discarded. The app can subsequently call SetContentList(), Prebuffer() and Play() to play back a new video.

Additional considerations
-------------------------

To make use of the "fast start" feature, when an app enters the springboard (or movie details) screen, it must create a roVideoPlayer or roVideoScreen, and prebuffer the video. There are a few things to consider.

### Prebuffer position

Apps may have multiple play options on the springboard screen, including resuming playback and playback from start. A bookmarked position may be set in content meta-data to indicate the playback start position. Each play option will have a different play position associated with it. The bookmark position will have to default to one of the play positions and prebuffer the content from here. If the user selects the other play option, the data must be buffered again.

### Resuming playback

A user may exit playback to go back to the springboard screen, and then resume playback of the same video. Since the roVideoPlayer will have buffered the data, the app will ideally just resume playback. When going back to the springboard screen, Roku recommends that playback should be paused on roVideoPlayer. A user request to resume playback will take effect instantaneously. If the user starts playback from the beginning, then the roVideoPlayer must be stopped first, the BOOKMARKPOSITION modified in content meta-data, and a new playback session started.
