Introduction to Roku development
================================

With the number #1 TV streaming platform in the United States and Mexico and 89.8 million streaming households, Roku is at the forefront of the streaming revolution. The Roku OS is built specifically for streaming, which means developers can seamlessly build intuitive, high-performance streaming apps designed especially for the TV. If you have a video catalog ready for distribution, this document will help you get started building a Roku app.

Programming languages
---------------------

Creating a Roku app involves two programming languages: SceneGraph and BrightScript. These languages are used together similarly to how HTML and JavaScript are used for designing Web pages. SceneGraph is Roku's proprietary object-oriented XML framework. It is used to design the app UI. BrightScript is Roku's scripting language that is used to define the app behavior.

Tools
-----

Roku provides developers with a suite of tools to make developing an app fast and easy. This includes a layout editor to help design the app UI, resource monitoring and profiling tools to help improve app performance, and a test framework for automating UI tests.

The Roku developer community also provides a number of popular tools that streamline Roku development, including the [BrightScript extension for the Visual Studio Code IDE](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=celsoaf.brightscript). This IDE features direct client-side validation, interactive debug sessions, automatic code formatting, in-editor telnet log, symbol navigation, and many other features that make Roku development easier.
