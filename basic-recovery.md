Basic Subscription Recovery
===========================

When payment for a subscription auto-renewal fails, Roku's basic subscription recovery feature gives customers a 3-day grace period where they can continue accessing content, while Roku Pay notifies them daily via email to update their method of payment (MOP). Once the 3-day grace period expires, the subscription is canceled. This solution helps the publisher improve the chance of recovering payments and thereby reduce passive cancelations.

> Effective October 1, 2024, all apps using Roku Pay must implement Enhanced Subscription Recovery to pass [certification](/docs/developer-program/certification/certification.md#4-channel-operation). As a result, apps using basic subscription recovery solution must migrate to [Enhanced Subscription Recovery](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/subscription-recovery/subscription-on-hold.md).

Overview
--------

When the auto-renewal of a customer's subscription fails, Roku Pay automatically places the subscription in recovery. When a subscription is in recovery, the customer is given a grace period where they may continue accessing content for 3 days. During this 3-day grace period, the customer is notified daily via email to update their MOP.

If Roku receives a payment during the 3-day grace period, it is processed and entitlement is maintained (the billing period also remains the same). If no payment is received by the end of the 3-day grace period, the subscription is canceled.

Email renewal notifications
---------------------------

Roku sends email notifications prompting the customer to update their MOP or manage their subscription online at [my.roku.com](http://my.roku.com/).

Entitlement checks
------------------

Publishers can use the Roku Pay APIs to check whether a subscription is current, on hold, or canceled. The [ChannelStore API](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getallpurchases) can be used to check the subscription status client-side upon app launch and then block access to content based on the results; the [Roku Pay web service APIs](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/roku-web-service.md) can be used server-side for regular nightly syncs to update the publisher's entitlement service.

### ChannelStore API

When customers launch an app, the app should call the ChannelStore [getAllPurchases](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getallpurchases) API, as part of the required on-device authentication, to determine whether to block access to content. The [getAllPurchases](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getallpurchases) API returns an **inDunning** flag that can be used along with the **status** field to get the status of a subscription:

| Subscription state | **"inDunning"** | **"status"** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Current | false | Valid |
| In recovery (3-day grace period) | true | Valid |
| Canceled | false | Invalid |

### Roku Pay web service APIs

The publisher should routinely synchronize their entitlement service with the Roku Pay web services to make sure their system has up-to-date entitlement data. Publishers can call the [validate-transaction API](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/roku-web-service.md#managing-subscription-recovery) as part of a nightly batch routine to get the updated status of customers' subscriptions. This API returns an **isEntitled** flag that can be used along with the **expirationDate** field and **cancelled** flag to get the status of a subscription:

| Subscription state | **"isEntitled"** | **"expirationDate"** | **"cancelled"** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Current | true | future date | false |
| In recovery (3-day grace period) | true | current or past date | false |
| Canceled | false | past date | true |

> **Free trials:** When a free trial ends and the customer's method of payment fails, the `is_entitled` flag is set to "false", and the subscription is automatically cancelled (there is no grace period in this case).

Push notifications
------------------

Roku Pay sends a [GraceInitiated push notification](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/push-notifications.md#in-grace-period) when a subscription is put on hold, it sends a [GraceRecovered](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/push-notifications.md#in-grace-period) notification when the subscription is recovered (renewed after being put in a grace period):
