| [roMessagePort](/docs/references/brightscript/components/romessageport.md "roMessagePort") | A Message Port is the place messages (events) are sent |

Supported methods
-----------------

### WaitMessage(timeout as Integer) as Dynamic

#### Description

Waits until an event object is available or timeout milliseconds have passed.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| timeout | Integer | The number of milliseconds to wait for a message. If this parameter is set to 0, this method waits indefinitely for a message, with no timeout.  <br>  <br>The native [wait()](/docs/references/brightscript/language/global-utility-functions.md#waittimeout-as-integer-port-as-object-as-object) function can also be used to get the event object which WaitMessage() would return. This means that the following two statements have the same effect:  <br><br>    msg = port.WaitMessage(timeout)<br>    msg = wait(timeout, port) |

#### Return Value

If an event is available, it is returned. If the timeout expires, invalid is returned.

### GetMessage() as Dynamic

#### Description

If an event object is available, it is returned. Otherwise invalid is returned. The method returns immediately in either case and does not wait.

#### Return Value

An event object.

### PeekMessage() as Dynamic

#### Description

This method is similar to the [GetMessage()](#getmessage-as-dynamic) method, but the returned object (if not invalid) remains in the message queue. A later call to [WaitMessage()](#waitmessagetimeout-as-integer-as-dynamic), [GetMessage()](#getmessage-as-dynamic) or PeekMessage() will return the same message.

#### Return Value

An event object.
