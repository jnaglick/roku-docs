| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [roArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roarray.md "roArray") | An array stores an indexed collection of BrightScript objects. Each entry of an array can be a different type, or they may all of the same type |
| [roByteArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/robytearray.md "roByteArray") | The byte array component is used to contain and manipulate an arbitrary array of bytes |
| [roList](/docs/references/brightscript/components/rolist.md "roList") | The list object implements the interfaces: ifList, ifArray, ifEnum and therefore can behave like an array that can dynamically add members |
| [roXMLList](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roxmllist.md "roXMLList") | Contains a list of roXML objects |
