Supported methods
-----------------

### GetBitmap() as Object

#### Description

Returns the roBitmap object of the bitmap to which this region refers. A region is always a section of a bitmap.

#### Return Value

An roBitmap object of the bitmap.

### GetX() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the x coordinate of the region in its bitmap.

#### Return Value

The x coordinate value

### GetY() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the y coordinate of the region in its bitmap.

#### Return Value

The y coordinate value

### GetWidth() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the width of the region.

#### Return Value

The width of the region.

### GetHeight() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the height of the region.

#### Return Value

The height of the region.

### Offset(x as Dynamic, y as Dynamic, w as Dynamic, h as Dynamic) as Void

#### Description

Adds the passed parameters x,y, w, and h to the values of those roRegion fields. Respects the wrap setting when adjusting the fields by the offsets.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x   | Dynamic | The x-coordinate of the region. |
| y   | Dynamic | The y-coordinate of the region. |
| w   | Dynamic | The width of the region. |
| h   | Dynamic | The height of the region. |

### Set(srcRegion as Object) as Void

#### Description

Initializes the fields of this region to be the same as the values of the fields in the srcRegion.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| srcRegion | Object | An roRegion object. |

### Copy() as Object

#### Description

Returns a newly created copy of the region as a new [roRegion](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roregion.md "roRegion") object.

#### Return Value

An roRegion Object.

### SetWrap(wrap as Boolean) as Void

#### Description

Wraps any part of a region that extends beyond the bounds of its bitmap to the other side of the bitmap and renders it there.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wrap | Boolean | A flag specifying whether wrapping of the region is enabled. If this flag is set to false, the part of the region beyond the bounds of its bitmap is not rendered. |

### GetWrap() as Boolean

#### Description

Returns if the region can be wrapped.

#### Parameters

A flag indicating whether wrapping of the region is enabled.

### SetTime(time as Integer) as Void

#### Description

Sets the duration of each frame of any animated sprite that uses this region.

#### Parameters

A flag indicating whether wrapping of region is enabled.

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| time | Integer | The "frame hold time" in milliseconds. |

### GetTime() as Integer

| Name | Return Type | Return Value | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| GetTime | Integer | Milliseconds - Integer | Returns the "frame hold time" in milliseconds |

### SetPretranslation(x as Integer, y as Integer) as Void

#### Description

Sets the pre-translation for DrawObject, DrawRotatedObject, and DrawScaledObject.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| x   | Integer | The pre-translation x-value. |
| y   | Integer | The pre-translation y-value. |

### GetPretranslationX() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the pre-translation x value.

#### Return Value

The pre-translation x value.

### GetPretranslationY() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the pre-translation y value.

#### Return Value

The pre-translation y value.

### SetScaleMode(mode as Integer) as Void

#### Description

Sets the scaling mode used for DrawScaledObject.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| mode | Integer | The scaling mode, which may be one of the following values:<br><br>*   0 = fast scaling operation (may have jaggies)<br>*   1 = smooth scaling operation (may be slow) |

### GetScaleMode() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the scaling mode.

#### Return Value

The scaling mode, which may be one of the following values:

*   0 = fast scaling operation (may have jaggies)
*   1 = smooth scaling operation (may be slow)

### SetCollisionType(collisiontype as Integer) as Void

#### Description

Sets the type of region to be used for collision tests with this sprite.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| collisiontype | Integer | The collision type, which may be one of the following values:<br><br>*   Type 0– Use the entire defined region of the sprite. Type 0 is the default<br>*   Type 1 – Use the defined rectangular region specified by the SetCollisionRectangle() method<br>*   Type 2 – Use a circular region specified by the SetCollisionCircle() method |

### GetCollisionType() as Integer

#### Description

Returns the collision type.

#### Return Value

The collision type, which may be one of the following values:

*   Type 0– Use the entire defined region of the sprite. Type 0 is the default
*   Type 1 – Use the defined rectangular region specified by the SetCollisionRectangle() method
