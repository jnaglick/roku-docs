roRemoteInfo
============

The roRemoteInfo component provides an interface to obtain attributes about the Roku remote control that is currently connected to the Roku device. Note that a Roku remote control device that is paired with a device, may not be the one that is currently connected (a single remote is typically connected to a device at a time).

This object is created with no parameters:

`CreateObject("roRemoteInfo")`

**Example**

    remoteInfo = CreateObject("roRemoteInfo")
    print remoteInfo.GetModel(0)
    print remoteInfo.IsAwake(0)
    print remoteInfo.hasFeature("voicecapture", 0)
    

**Output**

The output from the above code could be as follows:

    538
    false
    true
