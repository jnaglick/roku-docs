ContentNode
===========

Extends [**Node**](/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md)

The ContentNode class allows you to specify the data used to configure a node or component. Many nodes and components require a ContentNode as the specification of their content field in order to be properly configured. In general, lists, grids, and panels require a ContentNode for configuration. The data included in a ContentNode can be data such as the text for labels in the node or component, and the spacing between items in a list, grid, or panel, including data to create custom lists, grids, and panels. The reference information for every node or component that requires a ContentNode includes a section that details the requirements of the ContentNode for that node or component.

ContentNodes defined as the specification for a node or component content field are typically structured as one ContentNode parent node, with a hierarchy of child nodes that specify the actual data, and sections of data if needed. For example, a [LabelList](/docs/references/scenegraph/list-and-grid-nodes/labellist.md "LabelList") node can have several sections that divide the entire list, each with their own section heading, and specific items in that section of the list. The ContentNode for that LabelList node should have two levels of child ContentNodes, one level for the data to configure the list sections, and then another level of child ContentNodes for the data for each item in that list section.

A ContentNode can also be used to specify the data for custom components with defined interfaces, and for nodes and components that require [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md " Content Meta-Data"). Also, you should use a ContentNode for complex structures of data for your application rather than associative arrays. ContentNode objects are passed by reference in the application, while associative array objects are copied. For large complex data structures, passing ContentNode objects is much quicker than passing the equivalent associative array object. You can use associative arrays for simpler data structures with just a few fixed members.

> All of the attributes listed in [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md "Content Meta-Data") can be set as fields in a Content node. However, when creating a Content node, the fields themselves are not created until the valid attributes are set as fields, using either assignment (=), or set using [setField()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.md#setfieldfieldname-as-string-value-as-object-as-boolean "setField") or [setFields()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsgnodefield.md#setfieldsfields-as-object-as-boolean. "setFields()")

### Creating ContentNodes

To create a ContentNode object and populate it with data, you can define the ContentNode in XML markup, or create it using BrightScript. In both cases, you will usually be first creating or defining a parent ContentNode, then creating or defining children ContentNodes below the parent, with possibly other levels of children ContentNodes.

As an example, to define a ContentNode with one level of children ContentNodes, you should generally:

    <ContentNode role= or id= >
      <ContentNode content_meta-data_attribute = "attribute" ... />
      ...
    </ContentNode>
    

The parent ContentNode is defined with either an XML role attribute or an id field, depending on how you want to assign or use the content data. For the nodes classes that have a content field that is to be assigned a ContentNode, such as LabelList nodes, the parent ContentNode should be defined as a child node of the node:

    <LabelList  id = "labellist" >
      <ContentNode  role = "content" >
        <ContentNode title = "Renderable Nodes" description = "Basic Nodes That Show Things" />
        <ContentNode title = "Z-Order/Parent-Child" description = "SceneGraph Tree Order Matters" />
        <ContentNode title = "Animations" description = "Moving Stuff Around and Flashing Lights" />
        <ContentNode title = "Events and Observers" description = "Reacting When Stuff Happens" />
      </ContentNode>
    </LabelList>
    

In other cases, you can just use the id field to allow you to access the ContentNode later as an object for any purpose. In both cases, define additional ContentNodes with content fields as children of the parent ContentNode.

To create a ContentNode in BrightScript, you should generally:

1.  Create the ContentNode object using createObject()
2.  Create child ContentNode objects using createChild()
3.  Assign the data to the field(s) of each ContentNode child object

As follows:

    ContentNode_object = createObject("RoSGNode","ContentNode")
    ContentNode_child_object = ContentNode_object.createChild("ContentNode")
    ContentNode_child_object.field_name = data
    ...
    

### Assigning ContentNode Data To Nodes/Components

For nodes and components that require a ContentNode as the specification of their content field, you can define it as a child of the node or component in XML markup using the role attribute, or just assign the ContentNode object to the content field as follows:

    NodeComponent.content = ContentNode_object
    

For other nodes and components that don't require a ContentNode, you can use getChild() or a similar function to locate the specific child ContentNode object that contains the data you want to assign to a particular node/component field:

    ContentNode_child_object = ContentNode_object.getChild(child_number)
    NodeComponent.field_name = ContentNode_child_object.field_name
    

> If you are assigning a component node field with child elements of a ContentNode, you should create the ContentNode and all child elements, then assign the ContentNode to the component node field. It is more efficient than creating a ContentNode, assigning the ContentNode to the component node field, then creating and assigning each child element using getChild(). This is particularly true when creating and assigning ContentNode data in different threads, which can be very inefficient. Also avoid getting individual data items or child elements repeatedly if it is more efficient to copy the data value locally and avoid the repetitive object accesses, particularly in two different threads.

### Example

The following creates a component with a LabelList node populated with some specific content. To configure the content, a ContentNode is created for the content field of the LabelList node. The LabelList node is divided into several sections, so for each section, a child ContentNode object is added to the parent ContentNode using the addSection() function. Then the individual items in each section of the list are added as child nodes of the section ContentNode object using the addItem() function. The functions access the global variables for the ContentNode object reference m.content for the parent ContentNode, and m.sectionContent for the section ContentNodes.

          item = m.sectionContent.createChild("ContentNode")
          item.title = itemtext
        end sub
    
        ]]>
    
      </script>

        <LabelList
          id = "coreList"
          translation = "[ 160, 92 ]"

Fields
------

All of the attributes listed in [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md "Content Meta-Data") are accessible as fields using dot (.) notation on a ContentNode object. For example, for a ContentNode object iteminfo, the Content Meta-Data Description attribute can be read or written as follows:

    iteminfo.description
    

You can also access ContentNode attributes as fields using dot (.) notation if you add the attribute as an [<interface>](/docs/references/scenegraph/xml-elements/interface.md "<interface>") element field to an extended ContentNode component. For example, you could extend a ContentNode as a custom listitemcontent component with a componentname field to include an XML component name in a list item:

    <component  name = "listitemcontent" extends = "ContentNode" >
    
      <interface >
        <field id = "componentname" type = "string" />
      </interface>
    
    </component>
    

Then for a listitemcontent ContentNode object iteminfo, you can read or write the componentname field in the same way as if it were a Content Meta-Data attribute:

    iteminfo.componentname
    

> You can only use dot (.) notation to access ContentNode fields as attributes found in [Content Meta-Data](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/content-metadata.md "Content Meta-Data"), or defined as an [<interface>](/docs/references/scenegraph/xml-elements/interface.md "<interface>") element field in a custom ContentNode component.
