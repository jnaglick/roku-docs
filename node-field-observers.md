Node field observers
====================

All node and component fields can have _observers_ attached to them. These observers continuously monitor the state of the specified field, and if the field changes, a specified callback function is triggered to perform an action in response to the field state change.

In most cases, the observers are only notified if the field value changes. There is also loop breaking logic to make sure that you cannot get into an infinite loop of observer callbacks. For example, suppose field A changes and calls observer function X. In function X, field B is set and calls observer function Y. If in function Y, field A is set, the setting of field A is not done, preventing an infinite loop.

See [Handling node field value changes](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/handling-application-events.md#handling-node-field-value-changes) for information on setting up observers and writing callback functions to handle node field changes. See [Handling component <interface> field value changes](/docs/developer-program/core-concepts/handling-application-events.md#handling-component-interface-field-value-changes) for information on setting up observers and writing callback functions to handle component field changes.
