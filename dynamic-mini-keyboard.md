DynamicMiniKeyboard
===================

Extends [DynamicKeyboardBase](/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/dynamic-keyboard-base.md "**DynamicKeyboardBase**")

The **DynamicMiniKeyboard** node is similar to the [legacy **MiniKeyboard** node](/docs/references/scenegraph/widget-nodes/minikeyboard.md), but with additional voice entry functionality. It enables text and voice entry of letters A-Z and digits 0-9. It is typically used for entering a search query.

The key layout is fixed based on the node's pre-built Key Definition File.
