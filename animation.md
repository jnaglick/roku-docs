Animation
=========

Extends [**AnimationBase**](/docs/references/scenegraph/abstract-nodes/animationbase.md)

The Animation node class provides animations of renderable nodes, by applying interpolator functions to the values in specified renderable node fields. For an animation to take effect, an Animation node definition must include a child field interpolator node ([FloatFieldInterpolator](/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/floatfieldinterpolator.md "FloatFieldInterpolator"), [Vector2DFieldInterpolator](/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/vector2dfieldinterpolator.md "Vector2DFieldInterpolator"), [ColorFieldInterpolator](/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/colorfieldinterpolator.md "ColorFieldInterpolator")) definition for each renderable node field that is animated.

The Animation node class provides a simple linear interpolator function, where the animation takes place smoothly and simply from beginning to end. The Animation node class also provides several more complex interpolator functions to allow custom animation effects. For example, you can move a graphic image around the screen at differing speeds and curved trajectories at different times in the animation by specifying the appropriate function in the easeFunction field (quadratic and exponential are two examples of functions that can be specified). The interpolator functions are divided into two parts: the beginning of the animation (ease-in), and the end of the animation (ease-out). You can apply a specified interpolator function to either or both ease-in and ease-out, or specify no function for either or both (which is the linear function). You can also change the portion of the animation that is ease-in and ease-out to arbitrary fractional values for a quadratic interpolator function applied to both ease-in and ease-out.

### Example

[Animation Markup](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/ux%20components/lists%20and%20grids/PosterGridExampleanimation-markup.md "Animation Markup") in the [SceneGraph Samples](https://github.com/rokudev/samples/tree/master/ux%20components/lists%20and%20grids/PosterGridExampleoverview.md "SceneGraph Samples") provides several simple examples of Animation node definitions that use all of the field interpolator nodes. Other simple examples of using the field interpolators can be found in the [FloatFieldInterpolator](/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/floatfieldinterpolator.md "FloatFieldInterpolator"), [Vector2DFieldInterpolator](/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/vector2dfieldinterpolator.md "Vector2DFieldInterpolator"), and [ColorFieldInterpolator](/docs/references/scenegraph/animation-nodes/colorfieldinterpolator.md "ColorFieldInterpolator").

The following example shows how to use some simple animations. It uses two Animation nodes, each with its own Vector2DFieldInterpolator. The first defines a translation animation of the poster image, and the second defines a scale animation. They are both launched in an init() function using BrightScript. When run together, the effect is to "bloom" the poster image on the screen.

#### Animation BrightScript example

    function init()
       scaleAnimation = m.top.FindNode("scaleAnimation")
       transAnimation = m.top.FindNode("transAnimation")
       scaleAnimation.control = "start"
       transAnimation.control = "start"
    end function

    <Poster id="myPoster"
        opacity="1.0"
        uri="pkg:/images/myImage.jpg" />
    <Animation id="scaleAnimation"
           duration="1"
           repeat="true"
           easeFunction="linear" >
        <Vector2DFieldInterpolator id = "myInterp"
        key="[0.0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1.0]"
        keyValue="[ [0.0, 0.0], [0.25, 0.25], [0.5, 0.5], [0.75, 0.75], [1.0, 1.0]]"
        fieldToInterp="myPoster.scale" />
    </Animation>
    <Animation id="transAnimation"
           duration="1"
           repeat="true"
           easeFunction="linear" >
        <Vector2DFieldInterpolator id = "myInterp2"
            key="[0.0, 1.0]"
            keyValue="[ [640.0, 320.0], [100.0, 100.0] ]"
        fieldToInterp="myPoster.translation" />
    </Animation>
    
    </children>
    
    </component>

See [Roku Devices](/docs/specs/hardware.md#current-models "Roku Devices") for model numbers and code names. When an Animation has optional set to true, setting the control field to start will cause the state field to change to running and immediately change again to finished. These state changes allow any logic tied to state field observers that run at the start and end of the Animation to be properly calledwillBeSkippedbooleanfalseREAD\_ONLYIndicates whether the animation runs or jumps to the end (effectively skipping the animation and rendering it in its final state).
