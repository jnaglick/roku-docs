roPath
======

The roPath component provides developers an easy way to create valid file system paths.

The roPath component is a convenience class that implements [ifString](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifstring.md "ifString") while providing additional validation and path inspection functionality. See [File System](/docs/developer-program/getting-started/architecture/file-system.md "File System") for more information about valid path names.

This object is created with a string that represents the initial path:

`CreateObject("roPath", "ext1:/vid")`

**Example**

    path = CreateObject("roPath", filename)
    parts = path.Split()
    if parts.phy = "tmp:" then print "this is a temp file"
    if parts.extension = ".bmp" then print "this is a bitmap file"
