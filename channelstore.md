ChannelStore
============

Extends [**Node**](/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md)

The **ChannelStore** node class provides an interface to the Streaming Store. It provides functionality equivalent to the [roChannelStore](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifchannelstore.md) component. In general, the **ChannelStore** node class allows developers to issue one of several commands, which involves the following steps:

1.  Set the fields containing the data needed by the command (optional).
2.  Set up an observer of the result field associated with the command.
3.  Set the command field to the appropriate string to start the command execution.
4.  The field associated with the command is set to a **ContentNode** object containing the results of the command.

Each of the commands starts a sequence of actions associated with the financial transaction that are handled by the Roku OS outside of control or monitoring by the app SceneGraph markup. The SceneGraph markup merely initiates the purchase and receives a final result.

Fields
------

### command

| Field | Type | Default | Access Permission | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| command | string |     | READ\_WRITE | Specifies the command to be executed:  <br><br>*   [getUserData](#getuserdata)<br>*   [getUserRegionData](#getuserregiondata) ()<br>*   [getCatalog](#getcatalog) and [getStoreCatalog](#getstorecatalog)<br>*   [doOrder](#doorder)<br>*   [getPurchases](#getpurchases) and [getAllPurchases](#getallpurchases)<br>*   [storeChannelCredData](#storechannelcreddata)<br>*   [getChannelCred](#getchannelcred)<br>*   [getDeviceAttestationToken](#getdeviceattestationtoken)<br>*   [requestPartnerOrder](#requestpartnerorder)<br>*   [confirmPartnerOrder](#confirmpartnerorder) |

### requestedUserData

| Field | Type | Default | Access Permission | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| requestedUserData | string | all | READ\_WRITE | Specifies the Roku customer account fields to be retrieved when the [**getUserData**](#getuserdata) command is executed.  <br>  <br>The default value is "all", which causes a ContentNode object to be returned from **getUserData** that includes all of the available Roku customer account information.  <br>  <br>To request specific Roku customer account information items (for example, an email address, first name, and last name) set this field to a string containing a comma-separated list of values (for example, "email, firstname, lastname"). The available values are as follows:  <br><br>*   email<br>*   phone<br>*   firstname<br>*   lastname<br>*   street<br>*   city<br>*   state<br>*   zip<br>*   country<br>*   birth<br>*   gender<br><br>  <br>In this case, the ContentNode object returned from the **getUserData** command includes the specified customer account information. |

### requestedUserDataInfo

FieldTypeDefaultAccess PermissionDescriptionrequestedUserDataInfoContentNodeinvalidREAD\_WRITESpecifies whether the RFI screen is used for customer sign-ups or sign-ins. This may be one of the following values:  

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| context | string | "signup" | Specifies the context of the RFI screen, which may be one of the following values:  <br><br>*   "signup": The RFI screen displays a "Let's create your account" title and lists the customer information specified in the [**requestedUserData** field](#requesteduserdata). The RFI screen uses the "signup" context by default. See [Sign-up requirements and best practices](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/signup-best-practices.md) for more information on implementing the app sign-up UI.<br>*   "signin: "The RFI screen displays a "Sign in" title and lists only email or phone attributes, if specified in the [**requestedUserData** field](#requesteduserdata). Other attributes are ignored, even if specified. See the [Sign-in example](#sign-in-example) for how to use this field. See [Sign-in requirements and best practices](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/signin-best-practices.md) for more information on implementing the app sign-in UI. |
| forceShowData | Boolean | false | If true, the RFI signup screen displays the values of the requested customer information to be shared with the app (for example, Jone Doe, jon.doe@emailaddress.com).  <br>  <br>By default, this flag is set to false, which means that the default RFI screen for the region is used. For example, in the US, the RFI screen displays the type of customer information being requested (email address, name, and so on).  <br>  <br>This flag has no effect if the context field is set to "signin" (the RFI sign-in screen always displays the customer information values).  <br>  <br>**Example**:  <br><br>    store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")<br>    <br>    ' Doesn't show user data in dialog unless necessary in the user's region.<br>    store.requestedUserData = "email,firstname,lastname,gender,birth"<br>    store.command = "getUserData"<br>    <br>    ' Shows user data in dialog.<br>    info = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")<br>    info.addFields({forceShowData: true})<br>    store.requestedUserDataInfo = info<br>    store.requestedUserData = "email"<br>    store.command = "getUserData" |

#### Sign-up example

    store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")
    
    ' Request several properties for sign-up
    store.requestedUserData = "email, phone, firstname, lastname"
    store.command = "getUserData"
    
    ' Store requested properties
     email = store.userdata.email
     firstname = m.store.userData.firstname
     lastname = m.store.userData.lastname
     phone = m.store.userData.phone
    

#### Sign-in example

    store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")
    
    ' Set sign-in context for RFI screen
    info = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")
    info.addFields({context: "signin"})
    store.requestedUserDataInfo = info
    
    ' Request user's email for sign-in
    store.requestedUserData = "email"
    store.command = "getUserData"
    
    ' Store requested properties
     email = store.userdata.email
    

### userData

| Field | Type | Default | Access Permission | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| userData | ContentNode | invalid | READ\_WRITE | Contains the results of a [**getUserData**](#getuserdata) command. The value stored in this field depends on whether the user clicks **Continue** or **Cancel** in the Request for Information (RFI) screen.  <br>  <br>If the user clicks **Continue**, this field is populated with the Roku customer account information that was requested in the [**requestedUserData**](#requesteduserdata) field.  <br>  <br>If the user clicks **Cancel**, this field is set to "invalid". |

### order

FieldTypeDefaultAccess PermissionDescriptionorderContentNodeinvalidREAD\_WRITEContains the order to be filled when the [**doOrder**](#doorder) command is executed. This ContentNode contains one child ContentNode for each of the items to be purchased. The child ContentNode must contain the following fields:  

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | string | Identifies the product to be purchased, as entered in the **Product Identifier** field on the [In-App Product page in the Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/products) when the product was created. See [Creating an order](#creating-an-order) for more information. |
| qty | string | The quantity of the item to be purchased, which is typically 1 for most in-app products.  <br>  <br>This is only typically more than 1 if the product is a "packet" of identical items (such as game points, number of viewings permitted of some item of content, and so on). |
| action | string | **For upgrades/downgrades only**. Set this to "Upgrade" or "Downgrade" to change the subscription plan from a previous purchase (for example, `myOrder.action = "Upgrade"`). The required values are case-sensitive; do not pass "upgrade" or "downgrade". See [On-device upgrade and downgrade](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/on-device-upgrade-downgrade.md) for more information. |

  
To clear an order, set the **order** field to "invalid".

#### Creating an order

To create an order, this field needs to be set to a ContentNode that has one child ContentNode for each item to be purchased. There are two approaches to setting the `order` field: setting it directly, or setting the `deltaOrder` field.

To set the `order` field directly, first create a ContentNode, then create one child ContentNode with the `"code"` and `"qty"` fields set for each item to be purchased. Assuming `m.channelStore` is a ChannelStore node object, the following Brightscript code shows how to do this:

    myOrder = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ContentNode")
    myFirstItem = myOrder.createChild("ContentNode")
    myFirstItem.addFields({ "code": "UPC2397", "qty": 1})
    mySecondItem = myOrder.createChild("ContentNode")
    mySecondItem.addField({ "code": "UPC4321", "qty": 1})
    m.channelStore.order = myOrder
    

The `order` field can be set indirectly as well, by setting the `deltaOrder` field to add or modify the desired quantity of an item. Assuming `m.channelStore` is a ChannelStore node object, the following results in the `order` field containing the same items as the previous example:

    m.channelStore.deltaOrder = { "code": "UPC2397", "qty": 1}
    m.channelStore.deltaOrder = { "code": "UPC4321", "qty": 1}
    

### deltaOrder

| Field | Type | Default | Access Permission | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| deltaOrder | associative array | {}  | WRITE\_ONLY | Enables the [**order**](#order) field to be populated incrementally. Each time this field is set, the **order** field is modified.  <br>  <br>The **deltaOrder** associative array should contain a "code" string that identifies an available item, and a "qty" integer value to indicate how the children of the order field **ContentNode** should be modified.  <br>  <br>For example, if the order is invalid, setting the deltaOrder field to the following associative array:  <br>  <br>  `{ "code": "Merchandise1", "qty": 1 }`  <br>  <br>Would cause an order field to be set to a **ContentNode**, with one child **ContentNode** with a "code" field set to "Merchandise1", and a "qty" field set to 1.  <br>  <br>If the deltaOrder field was then set to:  <br>  <br>  `{ "code": "MyItem2", "qty": 1 }`  <br>  <br>The order field **ContentNode** would have a second **ContentNode** child appended to it, with the specified "code" and "qty" field values.  <br>  <br>The "qty" field can be set to a negative value to remove an item from an order. For example, if the order field was set as above, and the deltaOrder field was set to:  <br>  <br>  `{ "code" MyItem2", "qty": -1 }`  <br>  <br>The order field **ContentNode** would have the second child **ContentNode** removed. |

#### requestPartnerOrder

| --- | --- | --- |
| code | string | Identifies the product to be purchased, as entered in the **Product Identifier** field on the [In-App Product page in the Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/products) when the product was created. For TVOD-exclusive apps, a single in-app product may be used for all orders.  <br>  <br>A TVOD-exclusive app only has transactional products such as movie rentals; it does not offer any subscription products. |
| priceDisplay | string | The original price of the product. Do not include a currency symbol (for example, set this to "3.99" instead of "$3.99"). |
| price | string | The final price of the product, including any discounts. Do not include a currency symbol (for example, set this to "3.99" instead of "$3.99"). |

Commands
--------

Each of the actions associated with a command string are described in detail below.

### getUserData

Displays the Roku Pay Request for Information (RFI) screen, which prompts customers to confirm that Roku may share their Roku customer account information with the calling app in order to sign up/sign in to that app. This enables apps to create and update customer accounts in their system without requiring customers to manually enter their personal information in an account creation screen.

> To pass [certification](/docs/developer-program/certification/certification.md#2-purchases), all authenticated apps (SVOD, TVOD, other subscription services, and AVOD) must use the [getUserData](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/channelstore.md#getuserdata) command to display a Request For Information (RFI) screen during the sign-up and sign-in workflows to enable customers to share their Roku account information with the app. Only if the user declines the request may apps require the customer to manually enter their information.

To use this command, follow these steps:

1.  Set the [**requestedUserData** field](#requesteduserdata) to the Roku customer account information to be requested. This may be set to either "all" to get all the available account information items, or a string with a comma-separated list of specific information items (for example, "email, firstname). Request the minimum amount of information required to create/update an account.
    
        store = CreateObject("roSGNode", "ChannelStore")
        store.requesteduserdata = "email, first name, lastname, phone"
        
    

2.  Send the **getUserData** command.
    
        m.store.command = "getUserData"
        
    

3.  The RFI screen's asks the customer to use their Roku customer account information to sign up or sign in to the app, and it lists the requested information.
    
    ![roku815px - signup-rfi-getuserdata-v2](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/signup-rfi-getuserdata-v2.jpg)
    
    ![roku815px - signin-2-rfi-splash](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/signin-2-rfi-splash-v2.jpg)
    

4.  If the customer clicks **Continue** in the RFI screen to confirm that Roku can share their Roku customer account information with the app, the [**userData** field](#userdata) field is populated with the Roku customer account information that was requested in the [**requestedUserData**](#requesteduserdata) field. If the customer clicks **Cancel** in the RFI screen to decline sharing their information, the **userData** field is set to "invalid".
    
        email = store.userdata.email
        firstname = m.store.userData.firstname
        lastname = m.store.userData.lastname
        phone = m.store.userData.phone
        
    

Overall, the [**userData** field](#userdata) field may contain the following Roku customer account information fields.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| firstName | string | The user first name |
| lastName | string | The user last name |
| email | string | The user email address |
| street1 | string | The first line of the user street address |
| street2 | string | The second line of the user street address |
| city | string | The city where the user lives |

| gender | string | The user gender ("Male", "Female", or unspecified). |

> For authenticated free and AVOD apps that are not enrolled in the [Roku Partner Payouts Program](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/partner-payouts.md), the [**userData** field](#userdata) contains a limited set of account information fields:
> 
> *   **Sign-up RFI screen**: email, phone, and zip.
> *   **Sign-in RFI screen**: email and phone.

### getUserRegionData

The **getUserRegionData** command retrieves the state, zip code, and country associated with the customer's Roku account. The location information returned by this command can be used to determine a customer's eligibility for regional-specific subscription products and content.

When this command is invoked, the ContentNode stored in the **userRegionData** field contains the following fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| state | string | The state associated with the customer's Roku account. |
| zip | string | The zip code associated with the customer's Roku account. |
| country | String | The country associated with the customer's Roku account. |

### getStoreCatalog

Lists the globally available [In-App Products](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md), which are available to all apps. When the command completes, the **storeCatalog** field is set to a ContentNode containing completion status. If successful, the **storeCatalog** field ContentNode has child **ContentNodes** for each available item. See the [**getCatalog**](#getcatalog) command for the fields related to the product that are available in the child ContentNode.

### doOrder

Displays the Roku Pay order confirmation screen, which is populated with information about the current order (product name, price, any free trial or discount offer). The customer can then either approve and complete the purchase, or cancel the purchase.

![roku815px - signup-order-confirmation-do-order](https://image.roku.com/ZHZscHItMTc2/signup-order-confirmation-do-order.jpg)

When the command completes, the [**orderStatus** field](#orderstatus) is set to a ContentNode containing information about the command completion.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | integer | Contains the command's completion status, which may be on the following values:  <br><br>*   2: Interrupted<br>*   1: Success<br>*   0: Network error<br>*   \-1: HTTP Error/Timeout<br>*   \-2: Timeout<br>*   \-3: Unknown Error<br>*   \-4: Invalid request |

If this command is successful, the [**orderStatus** field](#orderstatus) ContentNode will have child ContentNodes for each item purchased. The fields for each child ContentNode include the same information when the [**getPurchases** command](#getpurchases) is sent, but only the following fields are populated when the transaction is made:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| amount | string | Localized amount of the item purchased (post transaction) with local currency symbol |

### getAllPurchases

The **getAllPurchases** command is similar to the [**getPurchases** command](#getpurchases) except that it requests the historical list of all canceled, expired, and terminated subscriptions over the lifetime of the current user account—in addition to the active subscriptions. You can use this method to leverage purchase history in order to implement subscription renewal flows and more easily determine if subscriptions have expired.

When this command completes, the [**purchases** field](#purchases) is set to a ContentNode containing the completion status.

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | integer | Contains the command's completion status, which may be one of the following values:  <br><br>*   2: Interrupted<br>*   1: Success<br>*   0: Network error<br>*   \-1: HTTP Error/Timeout<br>*   \-2: Timeout<br>*   \-3: Unknown Error<br>*   \-4: Invalid request |

If this command is successful, the [**purchases** field](#purchases) ContentNode has child ContentNodes for each item purchased. The fields for each child ContentNode include a `status` field that indicates whether the purchase is for a current subscription ("Valid") or for a subscription that has been canceled, expired, or terminated ("Invalid"), and the following information about the purchased item:

| Field | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| code | string | The product identifier, as entered in the **Product Identifier** field on the [In-App Product page in the Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/products) when the product was created. |
| cost | string | Localized cost of the item (prior to purchase) with local currency symbol |
| expirationDate | string | The subscription expiration date ([ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format) |
| freeTrialQuantity | integer | If the product has a free trial offer, the length of the trial period. For example, **1** for a 1-month free trial or **7** for a 7-day free trial. |
| freeTrialType | string | If the product has a free trial offer, the unit of time used by the trial ("Days" or "Months") |
| inDunning | string | A flag that indicates whether the purchased subscription is past due state because of an invalid method of payment.  <br>  <br>This flag is set to "true" if the subscription is in the dunning state. In this case, check the **status** field to determine whether to grant the customer access to content:  <br><br>*   If the **status** field is set to "Valid", the subscription is in a grace period and the viewer can access content.<br>*   If the **status** field is set to "Invalid", the subscription is on hold and the viewer cannot access content. If the viewer adds a valid method of payment, the subscription will be automatically renewed and the status will become "Valid". |
| name | string | The item name (this name will also be set as the description). |
| productType | string | The product type (ex. "MonthlySub") |
| purchaseChannel | string | Indicates where the Roku Pay subscription purchase was made:  <br><br>*   **web**. Subscription was purchased from [Roku.com](http://roku.com/) (for example, through [Instant Signup](/docs/developer-program/discovery/instant-signup.md) during the device activation).<br>*   **device**. Subscription was purchased on the Roku device (through the on-device sign-up flow). |
| purchaseContext | string | Indicates how the subscription purchase was made:  <br><br>*   **isu**. Subscription was purchased via [Instant Signup](/docs/developer-program/discovery/instant-signup.md).<br>*   **iap**. Subscription was purchased via an in-application purchase. |
| purchaseDate | string | The purchase date ([ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format) |

| renewalDate | string | The subscription renewal date ([ISO 8601](https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html) format) |
| status | string | Indicates whether the purchase is for a current subscription ("Valid") or for a subscription that has been canceled, expired, or terminated ("Invalid") |
| trialCost | Integer | If the product uses introductory pricing, the discounted price. |
| trialQuantity | integer | If the product uses introductory pricing, the number of months the discounted pricing is applicable. |
| trialType | string | Set to "months" for all products. All products using introductory pricing use "months" as the unit of time for the trial. |

### storeChannelCredData

Stores an OAuth token, custom token, or other custom data, which you can then retrieve with the [getChannelCred](#getchannelcred) command (the token is stored in the **channelCred.json.channel\_data** field). This data is stored securely in the Roku cloud and can be retrieved by other devices linked to the same Roku account. As a result, users do not have to re-enter their account credentials when setting up new devices associated with the same Roku account. For more information, see [Automatic Account Link](/docs/developer-program/authentication/universal-authentication-protocol-for-single-sign-on.md).

This command returns an roAssociativeArray with the following values:

KeyTypeValueresponsejsonA string in JSON format, with the following key-value pairs:  

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| status | string | The request status, which may be "success" or "failure". |
| error | string | A description of the error (if any). This will be set to "none" for a successful request. |
| error\_detail | string | A detailed description of the service error (if any). This value will be null (uninitialized) for a successful request. |

  
  
if billing is not enabled for the app, this field will include a string with a service error message.statusIntegerAn integer representing the request status. A successful request will return a status of 0.

### getChannelCred

Retrieves an oAuth token, custom token, or other authentication artifact (`channel_data`), or a Roku Partner Unique Customer Identifier (`roku_pucid`) if the app is using the [Roku single-sign on (SSO) authentication service](/docs/developer-program/authentication/roku-sso-authentication-protocol.md) for authenticating users. If successful, the ContentNode stored in the `channelCred` field represents the app credentials with the following fields:

KeyTypeDescriptionchannelIDstringA string representing the app ID (ex. "2213" for Roku Media Player)errorCodestringA description of the service error (if any). This will be an empty string for a successful request.jsonstringA string in JSON format, with the following key-value pairs:  

| Key | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| error | string | A string containing an error message (if any). This value will be null (uninitialized) for a successful request. |
| roku\_pucid | string | An agnostic ID (in UUID format) representing the user. This value will be identical when retrieved in the same app across devices linked to the same Roku account.  <br>  <br>If an app is storing an access token in the Roku cloud, this field does not contain a PUCID value. |
| token\_type | string | Type of the returned token, e.g. "urn:roku:pucid:token\_type:pucid\_token" |
| channel\_data | String | The access token, oAuth token, or other authentication artifact stored by the app in the Roku cloud via the [StoreChannelCredData](#storechannelcreddata) command.  <br>  <br>This field is not returned if the [StoreChannelCredData](#storechannelcreddata) command is not used to store an artifact in the Roku cloud. |

  
If the request fails, this json string will be empty.publisherDeviceIDstringA unique identifier of the device.statusintegerAn integer representing the request status. A successful request will return a status of 0.

### getDeviceAttestationToken

Generates a signed JSON web token (JWT) in the Roku cloud and returns it to the app. This token can then be used by the publisher's web services to verify that a message originated from a genuine Roku device. The following example demonstrates how to generate the device attestation token:

    sub handleData(event)
      data = event.getData()
      print data.status
      print data.token
    end sub
    
    m.channelstore_node= m.top.findNode("deviceAttestationToken")
    m.data.observeField("deviceAttestationToken", "handleData")
    ..
    m.channelstore_node.nonce = GetHexString(16)
    m.channelstore_node.command = "getDeviceAttestationToken"
    

**Sample JWT**

The following demonstrates a sample JWT that is returned to the app. Developers can use a [JWT debugger](https://jwt.io/#debugger-io) to decode this token.

**Verifying the JWT**

To verify the JWT, developers must [download the Roku device attestation token certificate](https://devtools.web.roku.com/device_attestation_token_cert/RokuDeviceAttestationIntermediateCA.cert.pem) and authenticate that the token is signed by that certificate (see [https://jwt.io/introduction](https://jwt.io/introduction) for more information on JWT verification methods). The decoded JWT contains the following fields

**Decoded JWT**

The decoded JWT contains the following fields:

    "x-roku-attestation-data": {
        "nonce": "5E0692E0A389F4F6",
        "channelId": "dev",
        "developerId": "caa73fbb5e75a46a4b6114de51a5ada7d616e2ed",
        "timestampMs": 1656377873990
     }
