Setting the monetization method
===============================

To add products to a subscription video on demand (SVOD) or transactional video on demand (TVOD) app that is implementing Roku Pay, you must specify which monetization methods your app will use: **subscriptions** and/or **one-time purchases**. This step is required when publishing apps to the Streaming Store; however, it is a best practice to set the monetization method directly after creating an app. This ensures that you can create in-app products without encountering any error messages in the Developer Dashboard.

> **Certification requirement**: Apps offering subscriptions and one-time purchases must [implement Roku Pay](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/overview.md) and adhere to all [Roku Pay certification requirements](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/roku-pay-requirements.md). Per the [Roku Distribution Agreement](https://docs.roku.com/published/developerdistribution/en/us), paid applications must use Roku Pay; they may not use any alternate billing service, direct customers to any alternative billing service(s), or encourage customers to purchase access to content other than through the Roku platform.
> 
> To pass certification, SVOD and TVOD apps (and other subscription services) must complete sign-ups and sign-ins on-device, without having customers visit an external webpage. The sign-up and sign-in workflows may not include links to off-device promotional or marketing materials, nor may it utilize off-device sign-in mechanisms such as rendezvous linking.
> 
> Apps must display the Request for Information (RFI) screen during the on-device sign-up and sign-in flows to enable customers to share their Roku customer account information with apps. Only if the user declines the request, may apps require the customer to manually enter their information.

Monetization methods
--------------------

To select the monetization methods for an app, follow these steps:

1.  In the [Developer Dashboard](https://developer.roku.com/developer), select **Manage My Channels**, click **Preview and** **Update** on your test app, and then select **Monetization** from the drop-down list.
    
    If you have not created a test app yet, click **Add Channel**, select **Developer SDK**, mark the app as **public** or **beta**, enter an app name, and then select **Monetization** from the drop-down list.
    

2.  Select one or more of the following options:

    *   **Customers will pay before installing my channel (pay-to-install)**. Pay-to-install apps are typically only used on the Roku platform for games and screensavers. Pay-to-install apps are not typically used for SVOD appsâ€”they do not enable customers to browse the content before installing the app, and they do not support free trial offers. See [In-app products](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/quickstart/in-channel-products.md) for more information on configuring these fields.
        
    *   **My channel contains in-channel subscriptions (SVOD)**. The app includes a monthly or annual subscription offering. Select this option for SVOD apps. See **In-app products** for more information on creating subscription products.

*   **My channel contains in-channel one-time purchases (TVOD)**. The app offers transactional content such as movie rentals, sporting events, and pay-per-views. Select this option for TVOD-exclusive apps (app contains only transactional content) and SVOD apps that additionally offer one-time purchase products. See [Creating TVOD apps](/docs/developer-program/roku-pay/implementation/tvod-channel.md) for more information on creating one-time purchase products in the **In-App Products** page.
