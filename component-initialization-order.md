Component initialization order
==============================

Instances of components defined in an XML file follow a well-defined initialization order when they are created.

1.  The [**<children>**](children_1608551.html) element nodes defined in XML markup are created, and their fields are set to their initial values, either to a default value, or to the value specified in the XML markup.
    
2.  The **[<interface>](interface_1608549.html)** element fields of the XML component are created, and their initial values are set, either to a default value, or to the value specified by the `value` attribute.
    
3.  The [**<script>**](script_1608550.html) element `init()` function is called, and all initializations contained in the function are performed.
    

Note the following implications of this initialization order.

Initial XML Markup Node Field Values May Be Overridden
------------------------------------------------------

The field values defined in XML markup in the **<children>** nodes may be overridden as many as two times, depending on the definitions of the **<interface>** element field attributes, and the initializations contained in the **<script>** element **`init()`** function.

Observer Functions
------------------

Observer functions of fields that are set up in the **`init()`** function do not get called when those fields are initialized. This is because the initialization of interface fields, or of fields of the component **<children>** element nodes, is done before the **`init()`** function that sets up the observers is called. Thus, in some cases, it may be necessary to explicitly call the field observer functions in **`init()`** if they need to be executed for the initial field setting.

Also note that field observer callback functions set up in **`init()`** cannot be guaranteed to have returned when the component is created using **`createObject()`** or **`createChild()`**. This means that a component object may not have been completely constructed immediately after those calls. For certain nodes that may rely on dynamically-downloaded content to construct the node, such as [**PosterGrid**](PosterGrid_1607203.html), subsequent object function calls may return an object reference to an unconstructed object.

Parenting and the Focus Chain
-----------------------------

For nodes that are defined in the **<children>** XML markup of the component file, the parent node is set after the node is created, and **`init()`** is called. This has implications for the focus chain (see [**Remote Control Events**](Remote-Control-Events_1607636.html)), which must end at a node derived from **[Scene](Scene_1607315.html)**. Until the newly-created node is parented to a node that is either derived from **Scene**, or parented to a node in a focus chain that ends on a node derived from **Scene**, you will not be able to set remote control focus on the node.

Program Action Fields
---------------------

Certain fields should not be set in XML markup of the SceneGraph nodes, specifically any control fields that initiate a program action, such as starting a video to play, or an animation. These fields should be set in BrightScript as part of scripting the program flow of the component.
