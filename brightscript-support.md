BrightScript support
====================

Several BrightScript functions and components cannot be used in SceneGraph component scripts. Many of the BrightScript components that cannot be used provide duplicate rendering functionality as SceneGraph nodes, and cannot be used for that reason. You should use the equivalent SceneGraph nodes instead, if available. Other BrightScript functions and components can only be used in SceneGraph applications in a [Task](/docs/references/scenegraph/control-nodes/task.md) node.

The following are the BrightScript functions and components that cannot or should not be used in the component scripts of a SceneGraph application, with additional information for many, such as:

*   SceneGraph nodes to use instead, if available
*   a function or component that can only be used in a Task node
