ifSGNodeChildren
================

The ifSGNodeChildren interface allows querying and manipulation of nodes in a SceneGraph node tree, such as creating new nodes, placing them at certain positions in the tree, and removing them.

Implemented by

| Name | Description |
| --- | --- |
| [roSGNode](/docs/references/brightscript/components/rosgnode.md "roSGNode") | The roSGNode object is the BrightScript equivalent of SceneGraph XML file node creation |

To use the methods in this interface to manipulate child nodes at the scene level, the subject nodes must be wrapped in another element, typically a Group node. For example:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <component name = "myScene" extends = "Scene" >
      <script type = "text/brightscript" >
        <![CDATA[
        sub init()
          m.myGroup = m.top.FindNode("myGroup")
          m.label = m.myGroup.getChild(0)
        end sub
        ]]>
      </script>
    
      <children>
        <Group id = "myGroup">
          <Label id = "myLabel" ... />
        </Group>
      </children>
    </component>
    

In the example above, m.label will contain the roSGNode corresponding to the Label node after the getChild() call. On the other hand, the following will not work:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8" ?>
    <component name = "myScene" extends = "Scene" >
      <script type = "text/brightscript" >
        <![CDATA[
        sub init()
          m.label = m.top.getChild(0)
        end sub
        ]]>
      </script>
    
      <children>
        <Label id = "myLabel" ... />
      </children>
    </component>
    

The Scene node children are hidden elements used by the SceneGraph framework. Thus, despite the fact that the Label node is in the scene element, it will not be retrieved by getChild() .

> Removing or replacing a node in a SceneGraph node tree can cause that node to be destroyed entirely if there are no more references to it.

Debugging-only Methods
----------------------

The following methods can be called on any subject node and return the same global results. They can be used in a development app for debugging purposes, but should not be used in a production app.

> These methods are similar to the debugger sgnodes commands. See [Special SceneGraph Debugging Commands](/docs/developer-program/debugging/debugging-channels.md#special-scenegraph-debugging-commands) for information on the debugger sgnodes commands. Also please note that calling these functions from code should only be done for debugging purposes. Any calls to [getAll()](#getall-as-object), [getRoots()](#getroots-as-object), [getRootsMeta()](#getrootsmeta-as-object) and [getAllMeta()](#getallmeta-as-object) should be removed from your production channels. |

### getAll() as Object

#### Description

Returns an array with every existing node created by the currently running app.

#### Return Value

An roArray with the all the existing nodes created by the app.

### getRoots() as Object

#### Description

Returns an array with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app.

The existence of these unparented nodes means they are being kept alive by direct BrightScript references. These could be in variables local to a function, arrays, or associative arrays, including a component global m or an associative array field of a node.

#### Return Type

An roArray with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app

### getRootsMeta() as Object

#### Description

Returns a string with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app.

The existence of these unparented nodes means they are being kept alive by direct BrightScript references. These could be in variables local to a function, arrays, or associative arrays, including a component global m or an associative array field of a node. These unparented nodes are organized as an XML forest of trees.

#### Return Value

A string with every existing node without a parent created by the currently running app.

### getAllMeta() as Object

#### Description

Returns a string with every existing node created by the currently running app (similar to the [getAll()](#getall-as-object) method) organized as an XML forest of trees according to the usual parent-child node relationship. Cycles are handled with a reference entry in the tree rather than indefinite recursion.

#### Return Value

A string with the all the existing nodes created by the app.
