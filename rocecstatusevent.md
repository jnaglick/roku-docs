roCECStatusEvent
================

The roCECStatusEvent determines the active source status for set boxes. Apps subscribing to the roCECStatusEvent are notified when the active-source status of the device changes per the CEC message traffic.

To use the roCECStatusEvent, follow the steps below:

1.  Connect a Roku STB to a TV which transmits and receives CEC messages.
    
2.  Select the HDMI input to which the STB is connected.
    
3.  Switch away and then back to the STB's HDMI input.
