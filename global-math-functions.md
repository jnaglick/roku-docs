Global math functions
=====================

The following math functions are part of global. Trig functions use or return radians, not degrees.

* * *

Abs(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the absolute value of the argument.

Atn(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the arctangent (in radians) of the argument; that is, ATN(X) returns "the angle whose tangent is X". To get arctangent in degrees, multiply ATN(X) by 57.29578.

Cdbl(x as Integer) as Float
---------------------------

Also returns a single precision float representation of the argument. Someday may return double.

Cint(x as Float) as Integer
---------------------------

Returns an integer representation of the argument, rounding up from midpoints. CINT(2.1) returns 2; CINT(2.5) returns 3; CINT(-2.2) returns -2; CINT(-2.5) returns -2; CINT(-2.6) returns -3.

Cos(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the cosine of the argument (argument must be in radians). To obtain the cosine of X when X is in degrees, use CGS(X\*.01745329).

Csng(x as Integer) as Float
---------------------------

Returns a single-precision float representation of the argument.

Exp(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the "natural exponential" of X, that is, _ex._ This is the inverse of the LOG function, so X=EXP(LOG(X)).

Fix(x as Float) as Integer
--------------------------

Returns a truncated representation of the argument. All digits to the right of the decimal point are simply chopped off, so the resultant value is an integer. For non-negative X, FIX(X)=lNT(X). For negative values of X, FIX(X)=INT(X)+1. For example, FIX(2.2) returns 2, and FIX(-2.2) returns -2.

Int(x as Float) as Integer
--------------------------

Returns an integer representation of the argument, using the largest whole number that is not greater than the argument.. INT(2.5) returns 2; INT(-2.5) returns -3; and INT(1000101.23) returns 10000101.

Log(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the natural logarithm of the argument, that is, **loge(x)** or **ln(x).** This is the inverse of the EXP function, so LOG(EXP(X)) = X. To find the logarithm of a number to another base b, use the formula logb(X) = loge(X) / loge(b). For example, LOG(32767) / LOG(2) returns the logarithm to base 2 of 32767.

Rnd(range as Integer) as Integer
--------------------------------

Rnd(0) as Float
---------------

Generates a pseudo-random number using the current pseudo-random "seed number" (generated internally and not accessible to user). RND may be used to produce random numbers between 0 and 1, or random integers greater than 0, depending on the argument.  
RND(0) returns a float value between 0 and 1.  
RND(integer) returns an integer between 1 and _integer_ inclusive . For example, RND(55) returns a pseudo-random integer greater than zero and less than 56.

Sgn(x as Float) as Integer
--------------------------

Sgn(x as Integer) as Integer
----------------------------

The "sign" function: returns -1 for X negative, 0 for X zero, and +1 for X positive.

Sin(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the sine of the argument (argument must be in radians). To obtain the sine of X when X is in degrees, use SIN(X\*.01745329).

Sqr(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the square root of the argument. SQR(X) is the same as X ^ (1/2), only faster.

Tan(x as Float) as Float
------------------------

Returns the tangent of the argument (argument must be in radians). To obtain the tangent of X when X is in degrees, use TAN(X\*.01745329).
