Supported methods
-----------------

### Register(path as String) as Boolean

#### Description

Registers a font file (.ttf or .otf format). Each font file defines one or more font families (usually one).

#### Parameters

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the fonts in the specified file were successfully installed.

### GetFamilies() as Object

#### Description

Returns the names of the font families that have been registered via the [Register()](#registerpath-as-string-as-boolean) method. Each name can be passed as the first parameter to the [GetFont()](#getfontfamily-as-string-size-as-integer-bold-as-boolean-italic-as-boolean-as-object) method.

#### Return Value

An [roArray](/docs/references/brightscript/components/roarray.md "roArray") of strings that represent the names of the font families that have been registered.

### GetFont(family as String, size as Integer, bold as Boolean, italic as Boolean) as Object

#### Description

Returns a font from the specified family, selected from the fonts previously registered via the [Register()](#registerpath-as-string-as-boolean) method.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| family | String | The font family name. |
| size | Integer | The requested font size, in pixels, not points. |
| bold | Boolean | "bold" specifies a font variant that may be (but is not always) supported by the font file. |
| italic | Boolean | "italic" specifies a font variant that may be (but is not always) supported by the font file. |

#### Return Value

An [roFont](/docs/references/brightscript/components/rofont.md "roFont") object representing a font from the specified family.

### GetDefaultFont() as Object

#### Description

Returns the system font at its default size. Calling this method is the same as calling the [GetDefaultFont()](#getdefaultfontsize-as-integer-bold-as-boolean-italic-as-boolean-as-object) method with the following syntax: `reg.GetDefaultFont(reg.GetDefaultFontSize(), false, false)`.

#### Return Value

The system font as its default size.

### GetDefaultFont(size as Integer, bold as Boolean, italic as Boolean) as Object

#### Description

Returns the system font. The system font is always available, even if the [Register()](#registerpath-as-string-as-boolean) method has not been called
