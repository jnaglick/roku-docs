Supported methods
-----------------

### CanRecord() as Boolean

#### Description

Indicates whether the platform and paired remote control can be requested to open the microphone.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the microphone can be opened.

### SetPrompt(prompt as String) as Void

#### Description

Sets the text to be displayed in the system microphone UI.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| prompt | String | The text to be displayed in the system microphone UI. |

### RecordToFile(wavFilePath as String) as Boolean

#### Description

Opens the microphone and records to create a WAV file at the specified output file path. Only tmp:/ paths are supported.

#### Parameters

| Name | Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| wavFilePath | String | The file path where the WAV file is to be stored. |

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the recording was performed and saved successfully.

### StartRecording() as Boolean

#### Description

Opens the microphone and begins streaming microphone events to the app. The app must have called the [SetMessagePort()](/docs/references/brightscript/interfaces/ifsetmessageport.md#setmessageportport-as-object--as-void) method previously.

While the microphone is open, [RecordingInfo](/docs/references/brightscript/events/romicrophoneevent.md#isrecordinginfo-as-boolean) events will be sent periodically with audio data. When the microphone is closed, a [RecordingDone](/docs/references/brightscript/events/romicrophoneevent.md#isrecordingdone-as-boolean) event will be sent. See [roMicrophoneEvent](/docs/references/brightscript/events/romicrophoneevent.md) for detailed information.

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the microphone was opened successfully.

### StopRecording() as Boolean

#### Description

Stops recording and closes the microphone. This method is useful if the microphone was previously opened via the [StartRecording()](#startrecording-as-boolean) method and the app needs to cancel the current recording prematurely, (for example, the duration limit was reached or an application error).

#### Return Value

A flag indicating whether the microphone was opened and closed successfully.
