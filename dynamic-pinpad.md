DynamicPinPad
=============

Extends [DynamicKeyboardBase](/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/dynamic-keyboard-base.md "**DynamicKeyboardBase**")

The **DynamicPinPad** node is similar to the [legacy **PinPad** node](/docs/references/scenegraph/widget-nodes/pinpad.md), but with additional voice entry functionality. It enables text and voice entry of numeric characters. It is typically used for entering short numeric PIN codes.

The key layout is fixed based on the node's pre-built Key Definition File.

Fields

See the [DynamicKeyboardBase](/docs/references/scenegraph/dynamic-voice-keyboard-nodes/dynamic-keyboard-base.md) and its base classes ([Group](/docs/references/scenegraph/layout-group-nodes/group.md) and [Node](/docs/references/scenegraph/node.md)) for descriptions of the fields that can be configured.
