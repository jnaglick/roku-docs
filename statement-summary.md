Statement summary
=================

BrightScript supports the following familiar looking statement types:

    If / Then / Else If / Else / End If  
    For / To / End For / Step / Exit For  
    For Each / In / End For / Exit For  
    While / End While / Exit While
    Try / Catch / End Try
    Throw
    Function / End Function / As / Return  
    Print (or ?)
    Rem (or ')  
    Goto  
    Dim  
    End  
    Stop
    

BrightScript is not case sensitive.

Each statement's syntax is documented precisely later in the manual.

For example:

    function Main() as Void 
        dim cavemen[10] 
        cavemen.push("fred")
        cavemen.push("barney")
        cavemen.push("wilma")
        cavemen.push("betty") 
        for each caveman in cavemen
            print caveman
        end for 
    end function
    

Each line may contain a single statement, or a colon ( : ) may be used to separate multiple statements on a single line.

    myname = "fred"
    if myname="fred" then yourname = "barney" : ? yourname
