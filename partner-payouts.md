Enrolling in the Roku Partner Payouts Program
=============================================

Publishers must enroll in the [Roku Partner Payouts Program](https://developer.roku.com/payments/) to monetize content in a Roku app. This enables publishers to receive payouts from video ads, subscriptions, one-time purchases, and pay-to-install apps (games and screensavers). Monetized apps cannot be published without enrollment.

> **About maximum tax withholding**
> 
> Per IRS guidelines, Roku is required to withhold taxes at rates governed by the tax treaty between the United States and the developer's tax country. For developers in the United States, a valid W-9 is required for zero withholding.
> 
> Without proper tax documentation (W-9 for the United States and applicable W-8 for non-US countries) and a tax treaty between the United States and the developer's tax country, Roku is required to withhold at a maximum rate of 24% for developers in the United States and 30% for developers outside the United States.
> 
> It is the developer’s responsibility to complete payout enrollment which includes providing their latest tax forms. If the developer does not provide this information by **March 31st, 2024**, the maximum tax withholding will be applied to all future payouts.
> 
> Once the developer has provided valid tax documentation, the system will apply the correct withholding tax rate on all future payouts. Any tax withheld from payouts will be deposited by Roku to the IRS. The withheld tax can be re-claimed back by developers from IRS directly when they file taxes at the end of the year by submitting proper documentation. Roku will provide an annual receipt of withheld taxes by January of the following year.

Editing payout settings
-----------------------

Once you have entered payout settings, you can update them anytime.

Receiving payouts
-----------------

Once Roku verifies a publisher's bank information and tax documents, the publisher's account will be enrolled in the Roku Partner Payouts Program. The publisher can then publish a monetized app and begin recognizing revenue immediately.

Roku will pay the publisher 80% of all amounts actually received by Roku from your end users in respect of your Application(s) through Roku Pay, after deducting any applicable taxes, credits, refunds and chargebacks, and Roku will retain the remaining 20%.

Payouts from Roku are made no later than 60 days after the end of each month in which Roku received payments through Roku Pay. For subscriptions that are longer than one month, payouts are made on a pro-rata monthly basis (for example, 1/12 of the revenues per month for an annual subscription) no later than 60 days after the end of each month in which Roku receives payments through Roku Pay.

No minimum sum is required to receive payouts from purchases made through Roku Pay. Payouts are made based on the specified interval regardless of the amount of accrued revenue.

For more information on payout terms, see the [Roku Distribution Agreement](https://docs.roku.com/doc/developerdistribution/en-us).
